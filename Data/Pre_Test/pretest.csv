1 :: Sharing my depression,suicide_watch,linkhunter10,1445290431.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/suicide_watch/comments/3pcnvr/sharing_my_depression/,"Hello everyone, I've been dealing with my depression for a while and I felt maybe I should share it and have someone's objective opinion about it. I woke up today like I normally do, but this was one of my mornings where I had my depression really kick in and nothing but thoughts of suicide would fill my head. I just don't want to bother anyone any more. I wanted to go away and don't bring anything negative to anyone's lives again. 
I'm 21 year old male living in the US, immigrated from Poland when I was a child and currently attend a university. My depression started when my mother passed away when I was 11. Since then I've had more nights where I fell asleep wishing I wouldn't wake up than with a smile on my face. I didn't want to kill myself because it would be cruel to my father, and later my girlfriend for me to do so. 
My father passed away less than  a year ago. And now I'm really setting myself up for ending my life. I stopped being a 3.5+gpa students, not doing homework, not participating in class etc.. Broke up with my girlfriend hoping she would find a guy who would make her happy, and that doesn't have  a messed up life nor mind. I started to push away all my friends and only talk to a few now. 
I doubt I'll have finacial aid to pay for school, I'm slowly having less and less friends and I don't have anyone significant in my life (no family) and once I manage to push all my friends away no one would be left to care. 

So what reason do I have not to continue this. Why should I believe life isn't going to get worse and worse. I just want to go away and not be a bother. I don't want people to know about  my depression because it's such a burden, or at least not experience it with me. I want to simply die completely. My body rotting away and my name never mentioned/remembered after i die. If I manage to be forgotten, then why not suicide?"

I've been watching Bojack Horseman and drinking whiskey and all I could think of is where is my life is going.

Everyone seems me as a top achiever, always been on top of my game, having the best I can be; everyone dreams living the life I want and everyone would kill me for what I have.

And than there's me - thinking that I either got everything I wanted too early. In high-school everyone told me that I'm a degenerate and need to attend a school for special kids and the best that I can achieve is to land a job at McDonalds. And now I got everything I ever dreamed to get at the end of my life and I haven't even reached 30.

On the other hand, there it is me again and I realize how small my dreams were; I realize that most people have it given just by birth (been healthy, having a citizenship and so on). And that I'm actually far behind of a place in life where I trully want to be. And the fucked up thing is - I know how to reach it, but I can't. I'm completely burned out.

It's been three days now where I was trying to read the first chapter in a book and I can't even start doing that. I've read 300-pages phylosophical books in a several days before, as well as built strategies for companies and solved differential equations in mathematics. And now I can't even read less than 100-words.

And the worst part is that I've been feeling like that for a while; for several months I'm not able to focus and provide the results expected of me. It affects my work, which affects my income and what I can afford.

I know the advises you will give. I am trying to take the break, but my problem is I also stuck in environment where I can't pursue my hobbies. It's purely because I don't have friends who have the same hobbies.

I don't even think I need an advise, what I really need is someone who will help pull me out from working 24/7 and feeling guilty when I can't work; someone who will become my gym-buddy, or a climbing buddy or something like that.

I'm very passionate about outdoors (climbing/camping/hiking/offroading/traveling), but don't do that much this days. I think I just need someone to pull me out from the rootine.

Anyway, here's my rant/request/text. At least I finally fucking said it after months of either keeping it to myself or saying it to people who don't understand it."

But [this guy](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BPfIdo0CAAEbrdV.jpg:large) is also considered attractive, but his nose isn't as well defined. while it has the same level of prominence the radix has more skin around it. and the flair is poorer than the first. the ala and corresponding ala creases aren't as conspicuous as the first mans'. 

[now this guy](http://a398.idata.over-blog.com/708x958/2/24/40/32/Jeudi-19-Juillet-2012/Sean-O-Pry.jpg) has a prominent radix which is ideal but again the alar creases aren't well defined. to me that looks poor but i was wondering what you guy's think. 

to me [this](https://www.shapiroplasticsurgery.com/wp-content/uploads/images/main_images/male-face_sub2.jpg) is the ideal facial aesthetics except for the nose (though it is very close). I told the plastic surgeon that these are the jawline and cheekbone implants i'd like but of course the nose has to match. so i'm curious what you guys think is the ideal nose. "

I'm going biking today, don't give a shit about the weather (it's probably going to be nice out). The hardest part is getting started, taking that first step, and I just need some friendly internet-person to give me a poke. Say ""you should definitely go biking today"" or ""I'll say boo if you don't bike today"" (but nothing more than boo - patience). History below, in case there's something relevant there.

And...I'm new here. First post, yay. I've been taking Cipralex (escitalopram) for an unrelated anxiety issue for about two years, but now...I just feel like I'm dying inside. I don't feel well-rested unless I've gotten 10-12 hours sleep and I'm doing nothing the rest of the day. Going anywhere exhausts me. Which is trouble, because of school and work (5:45 wake-up call, yay!).

Well, I first started feeling really ""depressed"" in the middle of last term (October). I stopped my hobbies (photography) because I couldn't muster up the energy, tricked myself into thinking energy drinks would help. I'd go zombie my way through school, losing marks along the way. Then this summer, work was hard physical stuff. I switched to a desk job after a month. I also switched to a gigantic horse-pill of that Cipralex. 

I used to love biking. In fact, I could ride across town hardly breaking a sweat. Got good gear, planned to do some long road trips for fun. Then I went into university, gained a bunch of weight, started having knee problems, things went downhill. Knee problems threatening to come back, but screw that. I'll bike until I can't any more."

Apparently, it started more or less with [this](http://i.imgur.com/sM00I9Q.png) post on Tumblr.

Now, in some ways I *do* agree that discipline is more important then motivation in many ways. Motivation only works with things you really want to do. Discipline works for things you want and for the things you don't want to do. Sometimes, you'll need to do things despite not wanting it so discipline is definitely better on that ground. Moreover, discipline usually holds better out in the long run. Meaning that discipline is better long-term.

But I don't want to completely dispel motivation. Motivation is an incentive, and can push you out of your comfort zone which can be a great deal to experience more out of your life.

When you're going through depression or similar issues, motivating yourself is extremely difficult. Even reaching out for help can be a difficult thing, even though you realize you need it. When you're broken down, and stuck in that dark, bottomless pit, it can be difficult to get out of bed. Let alone doing anything long-term, which requires discipline. Instead, being motivated to get out of bed, take a shower. Maybe even walk can help. Especially at depression's worst.

As I said before, I do think that discipline is more important then motivation as it's more reliable and gives structure to your life. But motivation should, in my view, not be discarded."

Starting post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/4lnpv3/its_time_to_kick_myself_into_gear/)

Missed last week, and this week's post is late, because of a lot of things, but it boils down to the end of the school year (I teach), going on a week long camping trip, and preparing to move out of our current rental.

**Last weeks goals were:**

1. Get to bed 6 out of 7 nights between 9 and 9:30.

2. Get at least 1/2 hour of exercise every day.

3. Mindfulness meditation for 30 minutes 6 out of 7 days, and 5 to 10 minutes right before bed each night.

4. Limit all internet activity to 2 hours per day. 



**What went well this week:** 

I think we met pretty much all of the goals, except for the bed time one- stayed up pretty late some nights. Oh, and meditation. That didn't happen. Had a very relaxing camping trip and 2 interviews for next year, hopefully I'll hear back today. 

**What didn't go so well**

Did not meditate hardly at all- I' going to scale back this goal and try to ramp up to half an hour over a month or two. 

**My plan for making it work better next time**

Meditation is the big one right now, partially because it's summer time, and we haven't decided what time we should be going to bed and waking up now that school is out. Right now the goal is to meditate for 2 minutes a day, building up to 5 minutes at the end of the week (baby steps!).


**Tasks for the week**

This is a pretty big week- I'll hear back from two interviews, and we are out of our rental by Thursday, though because we're living with friends we could theoretically take more time. Currently, the plan is to store most of our stuff in a friend's attic, and camp in another's back yard for a coup weeks until we know where we're living. 

Tasks include packing (which would include sorting through things and deciding yet again what to keep and what to re-home... we are aspiring minimalists.), finding a new place to live, and locking in a contract for next week.

**Goals for Next week:**

1. Get at least 1/2 hour of exercise every day- including a first thing in the morning walk with Fuzzytoes.

2. Mindfulness meditation for between 2 and 5 minutes 6 out of 7 days.

3. Limit all internet activity to 2 hours per day.

Twice in that time I have come close to killing myself, and tonight I held the razor to my wrist tracing where I would cut.

I have cried so many times, I feel so far from the guy I used to be. My wife says she irritated at how much I apologize. I am afraid to talk to her about me killing myself.

I get my adderall this Monday. So I hope that will help part of my problem. My next dr. appointment isn't till the 22nd.

I'm sorry if this is not the right sub,  just trying to reach out.  I would be greatly embarrassed to talk about  it with my wife or family or friends. 

Thanks for reading


Edit: I talked about it with my wife,  she is helping me through this.  I went and did some yoga today for the first time in years (her suggestion) and she took me to get a hair cut and some new clothes (I have not cared about how I dress in a long time,  and haven't gotten a hair cut in 7 months)

A few years ago I went to therapy and had been on medication. Therapy was okay, I didn't feel like I made progress with that. I also didn't tell her the truth about somethings and I didn't open up as I should've. The first two medications I was on didn't help much. But I didn't take them right anyway. The last medication I took helped racing thoughts and dwelling on embarrassing memories. Right now I'm just dealing with social anxiety by myself. And from what I can tell it's only sent me deeper into a hole. I'm suppose to graduate this year, but I'm not in school because it was too stressful. Everyday I was a nervous wreck. I don't have a job, my parents will probably start asking me to get one. I think I'm going to get my GED soon and hopeful about going to college. But if I can't even go to high school how will I go to college? 
I really want to get help with all of this again. But I have to depend on my parents to get me this help. Like finding a therapist and psychiatrist. They kind of drag their feet doing things like that. So I feel like they won't do it or they'll take a long time to get it all sorted out. And taking me to the appointment will be tricky. I just need advice on how to get them to realize that I really need help. Actual help. Because I can't continue living like this.

I just want my parents to know that I'm serious and that I need help and that I can't keep living like I do. It's sad that they haven't stepped in already and said something isn't right. She can't coninute to live like this. Cause right now, I don't do anything. I barely go anywhere. There's nothing going for me in life. At this point, I feel like I amount to nothing.

I live with mt parents and brother and my family is lowkey abusive and I want to move out asap but i feel obligated to stay because my dad is very, very old. he's in great condition considering his age bu t its declining. seeing him with his dozen pills and sad and confused and with his faltering knees kills me. I dont want to live or die guilty I dont feel like Im spending enough time with him and I know he tries to love me but his love is deluded by his idealization of his parents love and i thjnk he cherishes what i could be and what accomplishments i have more than myself. He gave me the cold shoulder on m 16th birthday bc i came out as queer and after scaring the shit ou t of me and threarening me and all of the people i hold dear (not really friends, just teachers)(Im pretty lonely) qnd then a week or weeks later(I cant remember my memory was sht because it was a dark time in my life) he was patting and feeling my chest much longer tha necessary to wake mee up for school one morning. it was a load lf garbage and a lot of grief but leaving and forgiving and coping just isnt that simple. I dont know what to do a couple nights ago(maybe last night?) as i was falling asleep i had a thought thagt maybe Im abusive towards my brother and its fuckign haunting me I dont know what todo about my family my mom is an older lady who nwver reqlly grew up and lacks empathy and compassion and she also tries to love ke but Im sick of her guilting me and her narcissism but Im afraid Im going to react the aame when she gets older. I just wanr to be liberated feom all of this I reallt mever asked to be born I want to live with people who love me wnd wont hurt me

growing up qas a mess and my depression was severe and I think m anxiety manifested itself as OCD(couldnt get diagnosed but not a statement im makign lightly) and I neverreally felt like i was worth anything until i made some really grade a people from a college i take classes at on the side last semester, and i really want to reconsider and reevaluate the people i call friends. recently i got a lot of people out of my life that i was never really close with.  all thats left are people wh ive met through the years, especially this one big friend group, and I cant kmagine not havinf them in my life bc I dont really have school friends and when Im with these peopl I feel great and loved but also a little ot of place and rheyre not good at communication and rarely check up on me(Im also at blame because Im afraid to reach out and ask and be overbearing or annoying) and I know being around them might be hurting me but being wround peope who love me even a couple times a year keeps me going

outside from that Km really alone and i hate beigg reduced to ths but growing up i just learned to repress every emotion i felt and now all of my aches are either crippling heavy sadness or physical dread and I feel so stupid for not being able to get up an d live my life ad I feel like Im ruining my chances at w decent future bc I cant even fkig study and I could be great and half way done with higher education by now but I just feel invisible and a failure I just need help sorting myself out snd to feel loved and wanted. I'm just too scared to do anythinf with myself now"
4 :: Circadian Rhythms,MentalHealthSupport,depression_anon,1421898178.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/2t7c3i/circadian_rhythms/,"Hi r/MHS, I was wondering if anyone else here has dabbled in light therapy or other methods to get your circadian rhythms to be in line with your external obligations. My psychiatrist is a researcher in circadian rhythms and believes it can help (specifically depression, but anyone really) a lot.

Your body undergoes all sorts of rhythmic fluctuations, and if your obligations force you to work contrary to those fluctuations, you will have a harder time feeling mentally 100%.

Some stuff you can do:

* Drug yourself into a good rhythm with caffeine and/or sleeping aids (melatonin is healthiest!). This path can be tricky but if you get your cycle on track it might be worth it.
* Light therapy -- get a SAD lamp and/or dawn simulator to use in the A.M. to make up for being inside too much. Bright full-spectrum light is an important signal to your brain to *wake up!*
* ""Dark therapy"" -- Just as important as light in the morning is dark in the evening. Avoid backlit screens (and/or use f.lux/twilight/etc.) in the evening and keep your sleeping area dark. Which leads to...
* Sleep hygiene -- your sleeping area should be used mostly for sleep (sex is ok), as dark and quiet as possible, and you should avoid doing anything in the hours before bed that could interfere with good sleep. Caffeine, drinking, smoking, and eating too late all qualify.

Anyone else experimented with this at all? I'm eager to discuss it. I'm far from perfect at the above bullet points, but I have improved my sleep habits quite a bit to go from insomniac/night owl to just groggy in the mornings before work."

He was such a good person. He was so kind to me. He was always full of life. We made plans to hang out and play video games together. But I was scared to invite him over again.

4 :: need help getting over Obsessive thoughts,Anxiety,Torn8oz,1474368174.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/53lbny/need_help_getting_over_obsessive_thoughts/,"Okay so, just as a little background, I'm a junior in high school and have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. I see a therapist about once a month and am currently not on medication. I've had general anxiety for most of my life, but one thing that has gotten more prevalent since I started high school are very obsessive thoughts. I'll be having a great day until a random worry hits my mind and I can't get my mind off of it for the life of me. I just think about it over and over to the point that I get nauseous. I keep trying to find a solution to whatever problem I'm thinking about, but usually nothing comes. This can happen anytime of day, but most often it comes at night. 

One of the main things that causes me to obsess is my fear of missing out. When I say missing out, I don't necessarily mean missing out on big parties or whatever, I even get anxious over missing small conversations. I'm in the band in my high school, and there are a fairly large amount of people I would consider to be friends. This is nice and not I'm not complaining, but it does cause issues when I don't know who to hang out with or talk to. If there's a case where everyone's together but everyone's broken into smaller groups, I have trouble deciding which group to be with. I'm so worried that if I choose one group I will regret it or miss out on something in another. When I'm at home, I spend hours deciding which friends are better in different situations or coming up with scenarios and deciding from there. I just get completely obsessed with it. There just isn't a clear answer to the problem and it bothers me to no end.

So, any advice? It gets so frustrating because I feel like I'm spending so much time worrying about everything that I'm not enjoying my time in high school as much as I could be, and I would love to at least make things a little better."

I thought it would be a good idea to create a meetup(.com) where I show up a couple times a week at the park with a few fitness tools and encourage others to join in and skip rope together, stretch rubber bands, lift water jugs, etc.  Any advice?

I need advice for:

###tools:
- a couple gallon jugs and a pole to hang them from to create a barbell? (there's a pond, so i can fill the water jugs there and avoid shlepping mass)
- stretch bungies?
- lift each other?
- a couple laps of the park?
- badminton?
- what are some lightweight tools i can bring that everyone can share, or that others could bring?
- etc

###What should we do exactly?
- how many reps of what?
- use the PX-100 or similar? (can't remember the name of the program)
- 5 min quiet group breathing/mindfulness
- etc

###Sociability aspect
- 2x/wk enough?  sun/wed/fri?
- a card to mark off our progress?  (weight, reps, distance, mood)
- dietary tie-in (everyone bring a juice without sugar? or a healthy snack to share?  hit a healthy resto afterward?)

To make it simple i want like 3 program options.  Each program made of 3-5 steps.  Each person picks a program and i give them an index card to start marking off accomplishments/progress a la /r/thexeffect.  Programs would be like, ""pick one: Chest/arms, Cardio focus, Tummy focus.""  something like that.

This is just a sketch of an idea.  I you guys make it sound doable and help fill in the blanks, I really want to list it and see who shows up over time.  I think that creating this will also stimulate some motivation on my part since i'd have to be the guy who shows up with the stuff. the man with the plan.  i'm already a man, just need some pointers on the plan itself :)

Or is this already i thing being done out there that i can simply copy?"

5 :: Estrangement from family?,getting_over_it,asteard,1472135529.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/4zh6xh/estrangement_from_family/,"**TL;DR:** I am the only Deaf person in my family. I grew up with a cochlear implant, and I talked. I learned ASL four years ago and have since realized how wrong my family's dynamics are. I have asked/demanded them to learn sign and they refuse. I thought that with them learning sign that I could get out of my depression. I want to be included in things, but I just don't have the energy to especially if I don't know what the hell is going on. Recently, I thought to myself that I should just forgive them and walk away. No one is perfect. And clearly it will be a long time before anyone budges from their viewpoints. I haven't told them I forgive them, though, because I'm afraid of letting them down, more so, me. I don't feel like I can talk to them even if they say I can. Their words feel forced. Frankly, I don't have the energy to do anything more than feel guilty, ashamed, and afraid.

----

I just feel like I need to walk away. My family is not abusive or doing drugs or anything. We just have different viewpoints. We're all definitely coming from very different thought origins. 

My depression stems largely from the fact that I am Deaf. I would say that the insecurities started in third grade when I was mainstreamed (went to a public hearing school). Before that I went to a oral school for the deaf. I was surrounded by people like me. I had friends. Then I was mainstreamed. I didn't make any honest friends until freshman year of high school. Anyway, growing up I talked because that was what I was taught. I had, and still do, a cochlear implant on my left side. It was fine. It worked. Then mid-way through my high school career I took ASL. Along with the language, I learned the Deaf culture. I agreed with it and realized just how many things were so wrong with my family dynamics growing up. 

No wonder we are where we are now. The dynamics are still there. I want to change them... But that is also changing them as a person. I can't do that. I can't control them. As various sources have pointed out to me over time. 

They don't want to learn ASL, and they have been rude about it. I admit--I haven't been so nice about it, either. I remember the very first time I brought it up to them. I wrote a letter because I wanted to make sure the right things came out and in the right way, but the more I wrote, the angrier I got. Since then I have tried again by bringing them to a family meeting, or--the last time--to my therapist. 

I have a big family--four brothers and sisters, and we're *all* at the same stage in life. College. My brothers are best friends. My sisters are so alike that it is easy for them to spend time with each other. I always found it hard to partake in those family bonding experiences. I've missed out on so much. 95% of the time we speak we are yelling because I didn't hear them correctly the first time. 

I wanted them to learn sign just so I could be a part of those times. There wouldn't have to be as much work needed to communicate something.  I honestly thought that if they learned sign that I could get out of this depression. I would now be able to talk to them and understand what they are saying. It's weird because it's my immediate family members that I want this so badly from, and not from anyone else. I could care less. 

I love them so much, and I know they love me back. But I feel like I just have to get out of here. It's just so much easier to hole myself up in the basement rather than stay upstairs with them all day. I've been down here for a month now. At first it was because I went to Germany for two weeks and hated every minute of it. Now it's because I feel guilty and ashamed. 

I do tell them--mostly my mom--how I am feeling at least once a week on average. I tell them when I don't feel safe when those moments arise. But beyond that I don't feel like I can talk to them. Even if the tell me I can talk to them. I don't feel like I can talk to them because of how they say it. It feels forced, I can feel their frustration emanating before they even speak. But then again we're already raising our voices because communication is shitty!

I've put a lot of thought into this. A few days ago I felt so bad that I just told myself that I forgive them. I want to tell them that. No one is perfect. I haven't because I feel like I will let them down. I will let *me* down. And I also draw from my ex-best friend. I know she meant well, as did I, but we clearly weren't on the same page. All I got was resent. I feel resentment with my family, and I feel like I will feel it even more once I say the words out loud. School is starting now so my siblings will be away. It'll just be me and my mom. Somehow I feel like I should go away, too, where none of them can ever find me. I don't even want to talk to my mom. I can't. "

Then she said she wanted to tell me something, and suddenly changed her mind. I had the feeling she wanted to say ""I love you"" for the first time, but was scared to. Eventually, I talked her into trusting me enough to tell me anything, and she said it. I told her I loved her too. And I meant it. I meant it then and I meant it every time I said it to her after that.

Ever since then, we've grown closer together. We would text everyday, compliment each other constantly, etc. She continually assured me that she wanted to be with me forever, and I let her know that I returned the sentiment. She was accepting of me and my flaws and made me feel good about myself. She made me feel loved, and I didn't see any reason we wouldn't be together for the foreseeable future.

We didn't get into an argument or anything when she stopped texting me. She also won't answer my phone calls or has blocked my phone number. I'm beyond devastated. I don't know what I did wrong. 

She seemed so sweet and so caring. Like she didn't have a malicious bone in her body, and even if she didn't want to be with me or something, she'd let me down easy.

I can't deal with this. I don't have anything or anyone to turn to right now. I just decided to check out her Reddit user page on a whim, since she recently broke her phone, and said that she had been trying to remember her Reddit password to message me, but couldn't find it. It's almost 1 AM where I live. My friends (both of them) are asleep, and so is anyone in my family who I could turn to.

I suffer from severe depression and anxiety, and was actually doing a little better lately. Then, when I saw her r4r post, I went from 0 to panic attack in about a second.

I don't know what to do."

This is something I have been meaning to write for many years and I never really knew where to post it. I also must take this opportunity to apologise. I have never been to a doctor about depression, never been on any medication either. So I apologise if what I am typing offends people, I don’t want to make light of depression or rant on about my situation when people are suffering through much tougher situations. I just thought I would state that first.

I don’t know when my problems first began, I think it was when I was in my teens. I had “friends” at school but I will be honest, I didn’t like them. Two faced bastards, nasty. I stuck with them because I had. Eventually I (which I could argue was the moment my life took a turn) got a PC. At first I tinkered with it and played basic games, but I remember playing Doom and my “friends” would come around every day and ask me to go out. To me, Doom was more fun than they were and I often ignored the door. The sound of them knocking on the thick wooden door still sticks with me, I hated it. I used to hide behind chairs and in cupboards just so they couldn’t see me through the window.

Eventually I went to college but my crippling social issues came to light. I rarely spoke to anyone unless asked directly, never made any friends and just went home each evening and sunk myself into my PC.

Over my PC use years, I did join an online community, Vzones. I remember seeing the advertisement in the back of a magazine. A pay monthly chat room where you are represented by an avatar which you can customise and move about.
My year or so using that service was, looking back, amazing. I made some good friends (at the time) using that service. I remember logging in, and dropping my avatar in a room of people and they all would be happy that I arrived. I met a girl on there and we dated/voice chatted and used web cams for over a year. We even got married on there. 

Just like real life, issues got in the way and even though I had a good thing going and I know in my heart if I had been a good person, I would have met this girl in real life, I fucked it up. I ended up digitally cheating on her with her online friend. She found out, raged and ended up fucking her old boyfriend in real life. She is now still with him and had children.

Vzones crashed and burnt and I left many years later. As years past one thing became true, I loved to play online games but I pined to have someone to play with. I remember playing Star Wars Galaxies, alone of course. TF2, Arma, Counterstrike, Battlefield etc. Yet each game I played I felt an emptiness. My life decisions and my fucking brain has had an effect. 
Here I am now, 33 years old, 2 kids, full time job and yet somehow very lonely. 

I had a glimmer a few years ago, a glimmer of what life was like for gamers with friends. While playing Arma one day, some guy in the global chat asked to team up with someone. I don’t know why but I asked him to join me and he did. He chatted on the mic and I reluctantly did too. A year later we still spoke, we played Arma often, Minecraft. I had so much fun, but there was a catch. He has a temper. I am someone who HATES confrontation. There was a few times where, for whatever reason, bad mood, he was very angry. I played minecraft with him and one time a tree I had planted grow and the chunk update moved a shit load of carpenters blocks. He raged. Swearing at me and demanding I fix it. Instead of doing what I wanted which was call him out on his shit, I took it full on in the ass. I clammed up and proceeded to fix the blocks like a mug.

We don’t really speak anymore, he was more of a Fifa player and played matches often. I would sit there many nights waiting for him to finish and eventually he would pop online and say “sorry mucker, going to bed now”. I had been waiting to play with him for hours. 
It got me down more and I relied on him, one person. I put all my digital eggs in his basket. 

Once a year my partner and our 2 kids travel up north, 4 hours away, to see her parents. I am left home because she knows I don’t really like family trips. I end up booking the week off work. So once a year I get 7 days of no screaming kids and plenty of free time, but this joyus occasion is tainted as I have no one to play with. I could reach out to this guy again, but I relying on him is a risk, besides, I don’t really like his attitude. 

I guess I am asking if anyone is interested in playing games with me during the times of 20th July to the 26th. I own Arma, Overwatch, Minecraft and many others. Beyond those dates, I am able to play late in the evenings (between 9pm-12 midnight UK time) and maybe on weekends.

I fear talking on microphones and I don’t know why, but it is something I will have to get over. 

Again I apologise for this. Reading what others post on here and I end up posting “I don’t have any friends so I’m sad”, does make me feel awful.

4 :: How do you guys deal with having episodes around friends? How do you eve...,bipolar,rose_garden1992,1474274585.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/53f3eo/how_do_you_guys_deal_with_having_episodes_around/,"I'm really fucked up over this and in a deep depressive slump. You guys are all so strong and I'm hoping you can send me some strength in advice to get through this. 

I had an episode that the other night that I THOUGHT I dealt with ok. I was in my home having a game night and I had to excuse myself after a board game was over because I wasn't able to control my thoughts. I didn't say anything bad, I didn't physically or emotionally hurt anyone. I wasn't even the only host who was home and in control of the night. My SO was there and continued to keep pace with everyone else as normal. I went about some calming routines in my own bedroom of my own home and resumed the night. I politely excused myself and said I had some things to attend to. I thought it wasn't a big deal.

I get the nastiest text message yesterday from someone who I THOUGHT was a close friend calling my literally garbage and shit and telling me I never deserved friends in the first place if I was going to treat them that way. WHAT THE FUCK?

How is that fair? I was having an episode and I went and took quiet time to go through coping routines without harming anyone whatsoever. She didn't even say she was mad when she left. She had refused to speak with me when I came back out of my room, didn't leave until 3 hours later, and slammed my door on the way out. NOT TO MENTION when I went into my room she tried to follow me and tell me I was being shitty for walking away. She came into MY room and I asked her quietly and politely to leave because I had a few things to attend to. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT? My house does not have an open bedroom policy. It is NOT ok to come into my room and people who come over know that because that's not only how common curtsy works but it is something I have also mentioned many times. It's not ok to come in here. This is my house and this room is off limits.

I spoke to another friend about this. All of my friends know I'm bipolar 2. This is not something I'm quiet about, but I also don't scream it from the moutain tops. I give disclosure of this and then we move on. I would THINK that people would remember this, remember that I'm trying my fucking best, I have successfully been discharged from the years of therapy I've been through, and I just take it day by day. My friend suggested that maybe ex-friend forgot? HOW DOES SOMEONE FORGET THAT I HAVE A DEBILITATING DISEASE? HOW IS IT OK FOR SOMEONE TO SPEAK TO ME THIS WAY? I NEVER DO THIS TO OTHER PEOPLE. I make damn sure of that. I suffer in silence and refuse to lash out at people. I will send myself home before I subject someone else to this, and this time THEY were in MY home. 

My other non-crappy friend suggested that maybe I need to try and communicate to people when I'm having an episode. Maybe I need to say ""hey I'm having a bipolar episode"". WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT MEAN? If I was capable of that, I wouldn't have a mental disorder. I wouldn't live my life in fear of this disease. Am I just meant to brand it on my forehead or patch it on my arm like some circus freak? Why do I need to announce myself when I'm the one who's suffering? Why can't my normal friends take a time to look beyond themselves when they're NOT EVEN SUFFERING and realize maybe it's my disease and not that I'm a ""piece of shit who abuses their friends"". 

I'd also like to mention that this ex-friend has a best friend who is not only a psychopath but a dissociate schizophrenic. I spent three years of my life being abused by that person and I ended that friendship for my own health. Friend A who called me garbage stands by the literally diagnosed as a psychopath friend blindly and could have her arm chopped off and still remain friends with this person. You'd think she would be capable of A LITTLE understanding to my position if she's capable of a lifetime of abuse from friend B. But no, I have one moment of weakness where I spend time in my bedroom in my own home rather than around friend A while I'm suffering and it's akin to killing her dog. How is this fair?

What do you guys do for your friends? Am I being unreasonable by asking for compassion? For not wanting this disease to be my identity. For not wanting to constantly remind people that my brain is inferior and broken? 

I've spent the whole weekend crying and feeling hopeless. I've spent my whole life terrified of people. My parents abused me in every way but sexually and one thing they always cited was because of how I am. It's hard enough for me to trust people to the point where I can even call them friends. I've been homeless, I dont have a ""family"" family since I went NC and got emancipated. Everything I have and everything I've built for myself now is through my own choices and the strength that I only find in a hypermanic state. I've been feeling as though I've been in a hypo episode for a few months now and this has sent me lower than I've been since my cat of 19 years - who I rescued from my parents who wanted to kill her - died last year. 

How do I even move forward from here? If you guys need to hear the vile and abuse that she texted me I'll post it. I don't even know how to begin to respond. Do I even want to? How do I protect myself from being scolded like a child? From being punished by someone barely a year older than me for something she SHOULD be able to understand. Is she just a shitty person?"

It has been hell since I've gotten here... I hate my job more than anything. I have a finance degree but I am put in a coding job. It is way more analytical than I've ever dealt with and I work 10-12 hour days just for training. We are about to do real client work and I am freaking out. The worst thing is... my coworkers, mentors, managers do not sympathize... I don't need them to hold my hand but they are condescending when I ask them for help. I believe my boss regrets hiring me just by how disappointed she gets after I can't solve anything. She keeps asking me questions that I don't know the answer to and it makes me feel like complete shit. My supervisor also picks on me during training, how I'm not paying attention. I feel so picked on by these ladies. Are women in business this mean?
I have to stay here for 12-18 months before I can transfer home, but I don't know if I can stay here any longer. I have cried every single day since I stepped into the airplane 3 months ago. I literally cry to sleep on webcam with my family and I wake up with the heaviest heart and lightly cry while I drag myself to work. Sometimes cry in my cubicle. I can't handle being this homesick and stressed. I tried to make friends at work, but they all either want to get drunk at happy hours (I hate drinking) or they decline hanging out on weekends (because they have other plans). I have grown unwanted thoughts ... I believe I can stay here for the year but I will lose it. I just sorely miss my family and my boyfriend. They all tell me every single day to please come home. I am dying to...
So on impulse, I sent out a few job applications two weeks ago just to make myself feel better. I got a phone interview a few days ago and they are really interested in putting me through an interview... it's all happening so fast, I did not expect this! I thought it takes half a year or more to find a job, lol. I don't know what to do if I get this job.... I want it, but my job will be so mad at me. Although I don't like my job I can't help but feel guilty since I've only been here for 3 months. But isn't your own happiness the overall priority? I can't stop crying anymore... I know if I go home that this will just be an expensive lesson that I do not actually like to relocate. I'm a homebody. :/"

Here's a quick bio of me. I have had trouble with sadness for a long time, and it started around high school. I often felt that I wasn't accepted or wasn't good enough, by girls or whatever. That took a toll on my mood. Whenever I felt moody, it was harder for me to concentrate for my grades and such. Then I felt bad that I was getting worse grades. This pattern of sadness kept with me all through college. After 6 years I completed an aerospace engineering degree, ending up with a 2.5 gpa and no work experience. Now, I am in a weird spot where I can't get an easy/normal job because I look overqualified, and I can't get an engineering job because I am underqualified.

I have always enjoyed games. It is my main hobby. It's nice to have a place where I am accepted and can succeed, instead of in real life where I feel I am rejected and shunned. Right now, I'm trying to figure out a way to provide for myself at least. I am currently living with my brother across the US.

I am a 32F with Dsylexia (reading comprehension below level of intelligence even though I'm above average intelligence according to testing), ADHD (inattentive type), and Dsynomia (difficulty recalling words). I also have generalized anxiety, and am an obsessive and compulsive perfectionist (ie pick at my skin), but I don't have the stereotypical OCD needs to perform irrational rituals. 

I take Wellbutrin (75 mg) and sometimes pair it with Concerta (15 mg) or Strattera (40 mg). Concerta helps, but I not as much as Strattera does with freeing my mind from anxious suffering and obsession. Other ADHD stimulants  like dextroamphetamine give me focus and energy but cause too much anxiety.

Strattera would be the miracle drug that helps me actually control my thoughts so I'm not obsessing and can focus, but taking it has these 4 issues:
1) It stops being as effective after a few weeks or I desensitize to it so need to take a higher dose.
2) It causes extreme constipation even if I take Citrucel fiber pills.
3) It takes away pain but it also takes away sexual pleasure.
4) It causes cotton mouth but that's the least of my worries.

What can I do? I find myself half-ass taking my meds because of the 4 problems with Strattera."

We text occasionally because we were friends before that and we have a common group of friends.
It's been a few months since we broke up, she's dating again. I'm moving to the USA (I'm from India) towards the end of August for Grad school and I'm nervous as F*#$. She applied to grad school with me and then later decided she didn't want to go. I still love her and hope she finds all the happiness in the world.

I just wanted to scream out, tell someone that I feel like shit.

I haven't got funding for grad school and doesn't seem likely I will since I'm not yet in the PhD program.

I took an ipip neo test that tells me I'm highly neurotic and have low self esteem and I'm not assertive.
I'm 24 and my hairline is beating a steady retreat.

I feel weak and pathetic and I stay awake at night thinking of all the ways my life sucks.
I'm not fucking depressed enough to get some help and I find my reserves of strength depleting. I want to punch myself in the face till I pass out.

Why the fuck am I not smart enough? Why the fuck am I not good enough for her? Why the fuck am I me?! I want to make something out of myself. I want my life to mean something, I want people to fucking remember me.

I can't live feeling this pathetic always, I need a permanent solution.

I do not really expect anything to get better by me posting here. I am just really grateful for the chance to vent. Crying while typing this has somehow made me feel better. I should start a journal.

Thank you. 
The worst part is, by the time someone replies to this, I'll be done crying and I wont be able to relate to the gut wrenching I'm feeling now.

It's an ominous family heirloom, passed down between generations. But you don't talk about it. You just hand it over to the next in line. 

Growing up, I thought it was normal to rarely see anyone smile inside my house. I grew up knowing that I smiled too broadly, that I laughed too much, that my voice was too loud. I could take singing classes, but singing just because I felt like it was abnormal. It was not right to do something out of sheer pleasure. At school, people thought I was weird, so I'd be avoided. At home, they could not avoid me, so I'd be scolded. I thought seeing my mother cry while ironing the clothes was normal. I would cry most days, too. 

It's not like there ever was any kind of abuse. I know it wasn't their fault - they were raised the same way, and they knew when we weren't trying hard enough. So they were doing the best they could. 

I remember the last thing my little sister said when they dropped me off as I moved to another city for college. 

""You have abandoned me"". 

I think about it almost every day. 

We both went to college. We both spent our college years being depressed, but highly functioning nonetheless. 

She is 25 now. She has an eating disorder. She has just been promoted, and although she's starving herself to death, she is praised as the reasonable one. She goes to work. She hates her life and is thoroughly miserable, but that's just the way things are, right? 

I am 27. I've been making my way through psychiatrists for eight years now. I have a job now, too. I kind of like it, but I should not say that. It's not fair to anyone else to say that I enjoy my job. They say I'm bipolar. That I feel things in an exaggerated manner. 

Sometimes, I do smile. I do laugh. But don't tell them about it. "

She was in decent health for a while. The last month, things started going downhill. I didn't want to accept what was coming, so I kept telling myself she was just under the weather and that she'd recover. That didn't happen. 

She's been here since Wednesday. Saturday was the last day she's been awake. She's been asleep since Saturday night. I guess she's making up for all the nights I kept her up worrying about me.

She wanted to be happy by seeing my brother and I happy, but that never really came to fruition. 

I've finally started to get my shit together over the last year. I haven't had a drink in 13 months (following what was essentially an 8 year binge), haven't had a cigarette in even longer. I self medicate with weed, but I don't consider that too self destructive. I quit my anti depressants cold turkey a while back (NEVER DO THAT).

I have general anxiety, and I've become fairly good at managing it except in one aspect. I have bad anxiety towards driving, to the point where I can't sleep the night before I have to drive as I'm so anxious to do so. Ive been job hunting as well, and I've been struggling so much with panic attacks and the constant fear of just having to drive that I can't prepare myself for the interview. 

I live in a rural area about 20 minutes from the nearest town so biking or walking is out of the question, but next to a freeway and a winding mountain road so I can't practice on a safe dirt road (I'm mostly anxious about driving around towns and cities anyways.) My mom has agreed to take me driving (driving with others eases it a bit) but we don't have enough gas money for me to practice as much as I feel I need to, and if I get a job I'll have to start driving alone whether I'm comfortable doing so or not. And I do have medicine for anxiety (trazodone, for depression and anxiety) but it makes me tired so I can't take it while driving. 

I read that anxiety towards driving is fairly common, so if anyone has *any* personal experience or advice towards me I would very much love to hear it. Thank you in advance to everyone who comments!"

I grew up with this girl and her twin brother, I'm best friends with the brother and I have always in some degree or another had a crush on or feelings for this girl all throughout my life since I was about eight or nine, maybe younger idk. But anyhow I went to a dance once with her and fucked that up pretty bad, we stayed friends from then on but I guess I never made any attempts to hang out with her all that much or actually do stuff like friends because I was scared, I used the excuse that her brother wouldn't want to be hanging out with both me and his sister or he would feel bad if I was hanging out with just his sister and not him but the truth is I was scared that I was going to mess things up more and hurt her or myself because of something I would say. I went through some pretty bad depression and when I started getting in better control of it I thought that I could move on from her. I told everyone including myself that I was over her and to some extent relationships in general. I ended up finding this other girl who clicked pretty well with me and we went out with each other for about a week and broke it off because she felt nervous about being in a relationship for the first time and I agreed because she didn't deserve to be a placeholder for someone else. Recently I started running a DnD campaign where a group of friends including her and her brother get together every two weeks and ever since I saw her again at the first session it's like I realized why I had feelings for her all over again. I am not good looking or all that smart and I'm broke. I'm not good with girls and on some level people in general even through everyone thinks I'm outgoing. I don't have a chance with this girl and she is way out of my league but I can't get her out of my head. I've been having nightmares again and when I'm being forced to lay awake at night I think about how she will be going out of state to a college to learn to sing (she has a beautiful voice) and that will be it. It will really be over and she will be the one that got away. I just hate that thought and it makes me feel like I'm going to be alone forever because she's the only girl I've ever felt comfortable with. I don't know if it's because I am ugly or if it's because I'm not charming or uplifting enough or if she just simply doesn't like me but it's tearing me apart. I don't know what to do. I can't see her every two weeks and keep feeling like this. She knows I love her, I've told her before but there has always been something in the way and I understand that it's not the circumstance, it's me. That just doesn't help. I wish I could just turn it all off, all my emotions and dreams and nightmares and everything, that I could just focus on myself and not someone else. But I can't. I care way to damn much and it's horrible and it hurts and I hate it. I can't stand being so close to someone and having so much history with someone and knowing they will never feel the same way about me. I'm rambling, sorry. If you read this far thank you. I'm glad someone is taking the time to listen to me being a moody teenager. Even if it's just for a second it's nice to know that someone cares. I don't know what to do and I can't sleep so if anyone knows what to do I would appreciate any advice. "
"3 :: You know, don't google symptoms of anything. Ever.",bipolar,ivybelle,1474098741.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/534uds/you_know_dont_google_symptoms_of_anything_ever/,"I've been sick for 16 months or who knows how long w some unrelenting Gastro issue. GI can't figure it out, but there are enough really general blood results (showing inflammation generally etc) that make the medical community believe something is up. Anyway, I've been on a considerable amount of phenergan for most of that time. 

Around Christmas I had to drop the last of the anti-psychotics we had tried because it was apparent that I can't tolerate them as a class. I get strange EPS symptoms of different fun shapes and colors from all of the many we have tried. 

I also am a sufferer of frequent intense migraines and am on prophylactic meds for those.

Anyway, today my eye started twitching around noon. I honestly thought it was part of a new migraine symptomology since my auras have changed recently (my neuro knows). 

Like an idiot though, I went to google. I found out phenergan can cause tardive dyskinesia. TD is my very worst nightmare. I was on atypicals for a long time before December, and have been on this stupidly high dose of phenergan for a year so I mean... AGGKK! I'm really hoping I wake up tomorrow and the twitch is gone and I am being a hypochondriac freak over nothing.

Ending up with TD for the rest of my life because I was trying to treat other stuff that is likely life long is not really an acceptable outcome. 

I am sure I am just overreacting and that is why I am reminding everyone not to google things. It's a TERRIBLE idea. 

End of PSA. "

But I just want someone to listen and give me their opinion on things.

I don't have a lot of friends. I have a lot of acquaintances, but you can't really bring these kinds of things up to those people, can you?

This will be the second time we've broken up. We dated for 6 months last year, he broke up with me because of his depression and then he immediately wanted me back. By that time though, I had begun to see the problems in our relationship. So I said no.

I was a mess for quite a while after we broke up. So was he.

He dated someone. I didn't. After they broke up, we mutually agreed to give it another shot. Well we tried, and he seems to think everything is going swell. But I have a lot of doubts about him, and I know I will eventually break up with him. I've just been figuring out when and how to do it. There are some things you just can't say to someone who you love."
3 :: Irritated by the city,bipolar,Aesa0m,1474073890.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/532w13/irritated_by_the_city/,"You guys, what should be experienced as inconveniences today (lots of humans all in my space, having to go around at least 10 double parked cars on one street, dude staring at me at the gym, banging next door by neighbors) have turned into me feeling so sad about my life in the city.  And even though I'm probably (not sure) moving soon because of this, I think these things might follow me to the suburbs.  My doctor recently upped my geodon script to 60 mg from 40 because of the irritation.

Somehow it all goes back to how alone I feel despite my 2 support groups and therapist.  I've isolated for like two years now, and I've tried to make friends here.  It isn't happening!  I'm worried that this will follow me too.

I've made a lot of progress here but when I get so thrown off by petty shit like this it's SO frustrating.  

I'm so tired of feeling like such an outsider in these ways.  Can anyone relate to this?  Thank you for letting me vent "

Ever since I've been on adhd meds in general, I get this stressed and tight feeling, like my bones in my feel stiff, and my emotions/personality has become blunt, hammered to a wall, unable to move. My Personality and emotions; unfortunately, has taken a dull and boring turn, and I don’t like it. it’s has negatively affect my relationship with my friends and family. Yet, Overtime, I was able to slowly conquer this black dog inside me with; positive reinforcement, therapy, exercise, and a strict healthy lifestyle. Surprisingly, things has gotten much better than before I started taking these meds. However, no matter how much therapy I do, and how healthy of a person I've become, I can’t silence the mental mood swings, impulses. In social situations, I feel like I can't unwind, relax, and relate to others, it’s like an un escapable stress. In social situations, it makes me silent, unconfident, and pessimistic. Then, at certain moments, it gets me irritated, and on rare occasion, mad at people who I care about. I don't show this side of me because I want to unwind with others, something I’ve lost the begining Ive start these medications. I've tried talking with the doctors for help, but alas, it is meet to resistance and restrain. Soon i'll be going to college, and, although my medications helped me focus and manage a B-B+ in High school, I just can’t keep living like this. In summary, if anyone can relate to this, anything a lot all, I would Greatly ask for you to provide any advice or explanation to my sorrow, and if it is the medications, myself or something else that wrong.
