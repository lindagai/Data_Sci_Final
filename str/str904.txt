Hey. First reddit post. Made a new account because I guess I don't want my main account (200days old) to have this so my friends can't see it. Sorry if I shouldn't be writing this here but I felt like I needed to say it. I'm apologizing in case it isn't good.Anyways, I'm gifted. That's what the tests said and what the professionals say. They say I have lots of potential, which I really think I do have. I want to have a nice life, still haven't decided what I want to do for sure. OK, I'm not going to delete all that stuff even though it might not and this might not be good.I have depression. Often I want to die. I don't want to have to suffer this life anymore. But I don't want to kill myself. I just want to suddenly be dead. I've learnt to act like a normal person even when very depressed. OK, what this post is about. I don't need, or really want help getting rid of my depression since it's a part of who I am and I am proud of who I am. The thing is... I just don't do the work for school. It's not that I can't. It's not that I don't want to. But my brain thinks that if I'm going to kill myself (I don't want to) one day, I'm better off enjoying my time now while I can.I play video games instead of doing homework and assignments because they make me feel happy. My school marks are now suffering significantly and I don't know what to do to help myself. I'm finishing grade 11 and I feel like if I don't make things better by next fall I'm not going to get anywhere with my life.Can someone please help me?Sorry if I didn't get to the point fast enough. P.S. I usually think I'm not good enough for other people.
