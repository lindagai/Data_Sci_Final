I don't want to die, I just don't want to live. I wish that I wouldn't wake up when I go to sleep. I wish a bus or truck would just run me over when I'm walking outside. Or that some mad man would shoot me down. I'm tired of trying and hoping, waiting for a change that will never come, hoping that someone one day will save me from myself. I'm angry and sad, I think about killing myself every day, and I will when my obligations are gone. I'll go to Amsterdam, it's not that far, smoke as much weed as I want to and maybe, but probably not, have sex atleast once in my miserable, shitty and pathetic life before I fucking end it, finally. I've been close twice but I didn't go through with it.I love my friends, my family and my dog, but I am not fit for this world, everyday is hell. God, I'm so tired of this bullshit.No need to respond, and please don't PM. I just wanted to tell someone.
