Not having a job, getting only one interview after sending out dozens of applications and the way things have been  going have just filled me with dread for what will happen next. I just got kicked out of my girlfriend's apartment a few days ago, when I called her out for cheating on me while on vacation. She just threw all my shit out. My car's a piece of shit, my life is a piece of shit and since I don't have a job right  now I can't afford to refill my meds. I'm trying to be hopeful and positive but right now I'm between jobs and places to live and I feel like a physic and emotional leech to everyone around me. It's just getting tiring
