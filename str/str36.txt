I recently read that when you decide you're ready to make a huge change in your life and picture your true self you should never involve family. Family will judge you on there ignorance and limited scope of experience plus your childhood failures. The failures that they unknowingly help cause. Sometimes I think that's why going away to school and moving from home is so important. I could have been a different person today. Do whatever you can to get out of that environment. A friends of mine killed himself and his family still has no idea why . I can't believe ten years later they still joke about how they never met anyone who could sleep so much and how ambitious he was \"that boy couldn't even get arrested\" but we sure miss him.
