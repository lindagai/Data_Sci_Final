I've had depression for about 15 years. About 6 or so years ago, I had a really bad episode, it never really 'let up'. Maybe 3 years ago, I came home to live with my mom, and things got better, enough for me to be able to get through each day. But I had a timeline on how long I could stay, and that timeline is almost over, and I am just so scared.I just, every time I think about moving, am reminded of it, I just see myself hanging myself in whatever new apartment or place I've settled into. I had a family here and now it's being broken up again. My sibling recently moved out, and every time I walk past her room, it's like, being stabbed in the heart, or something. I've never had much closeness with anyone, but for a while, things were nice here. I just want that to be my memory of life, and I want it to be over. I'm just so tired of being alive. I'm so tired of having the ability to think and feel. I'm tired of existing. I can't even explain my depression anymore, nothing comes close. I used to be able to spin a story up, and people would occasionally understand, empathize, even relate. I just feel like I am already dead, and all I can hope for is that death is truly a lack of existence. The only thing for the past few years that has stopped me from committing suicide, is knowing that I won't have my family there, like my family never existed. And that will happen anyway, one day, eventually. Part of me feels lucky to have experienced deeply, what love really is, because for much of my depression, I felt soulless, wandering, without a tie to anything. Now I have them and I hate that they tie me to a life that otherwise, feels like torture. I imagine all the hours I will spend alone, all the time I will refuse to go anywhere to alleviate crushing depression, as I always do, always try not to, but always wind up doing. I just needed to say something, somewhere.
