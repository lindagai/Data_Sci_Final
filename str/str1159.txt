I wish I could erase the past few months, back before I hurt you, back before my medication, back before I thought I was getting better, before I got confused about what I really wanted.I just, I know I made mistakes and that I should be patient, but I honestly don't know if I even want to get better. If you're happier now than you've been in the past five years of being with me, then I don't want to get better. I want to have never existed altogether. I want to disappear, I want to stop hurting, stop being a burden, stop feeling hopeless. I just want to no longer be here whatsoever. I miss you so much it still hurts, but you were so ready for this to be over, it's like you were happy I fucked up. I wanted to fix this, you're ready to move on. I put all of my energy into us for five years, and the moment I'm at my weakest you run. I don't want to be here anymore, I'm so tired of existing.
