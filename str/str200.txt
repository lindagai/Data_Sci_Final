Whoever is going around downvoting every post in this sub, stop. It doesnt help anyone. All it does is make it to where people are less likely to get advice because less people will see their post. If you've got a problem, fine. Make your own post and we'll talk about it, dont go around trying to drag people down further than they already are.
