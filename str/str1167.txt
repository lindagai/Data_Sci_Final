Any time a woman shows even the slightest bit of kindness to me,  my lonely ass brain immediately interprets that as her being attracted to me.Which then leads to months of conflicting  thoughts of "holy shit dude she doesn't like you Jesus Christ" and "oh man she looked at me today I'm in love we'll be great together."It's fucking pathetic to be honest, and it always makes me feel weak.
