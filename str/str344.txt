I feel this everyday you put this in words I couldn't, I see it makes me cry this society is addicted to greed money. One the reasons why I have a shitty job cause I don't care for money caused people who have greed people breeed and having kids?! no one thinks of the space that we need to tone the fuck down. I can't never have kids I would be unfit mother seeing the world I dont want a child brought into. I am from a generation feels like we are a future we should learn how to fix a mess but where and how to get everyone to work together. You cant why cause too many people have too many ideals that oppose another, humans as a whole are not peaceful more of us the more messes just pop up and damage is done.I want to care I have no Idea what to do nothing inspires me much anymore I want peace but as we continue to fight with our own race, greed with money and distroy our environment I don't see a future.I don't feel like I belong on the planet because I lost the privage before I was born.
