This is truly inspiring to me. I have always been lonely but just recently I grew a pair and asked out a beautiful girl who surprisingly said yes. We've been on several dates to the mall, movies, and even eachothers houses over the past few months. We haven't really done anything except hug. But if you can kiss the girl of your dreams, maybe I can too!
