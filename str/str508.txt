I just do nothing all day. I procrastinate, I rarely get housework done and i just overall don't do much to help my family. They are really annoyed at me and i feel so isolated and closed off from them... I really wish i could do more but i just can't put myself in the right frame of mind to help people. I feel useless and like i'm never going to achieve anything with my life... In fact, my disability is taking over my life :(
