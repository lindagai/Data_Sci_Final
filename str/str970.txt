I have a good support system and everyone is rooting for me and trying to help me through this. But it feels like it doesn't matter. I have no hope for the future. I've wanted to send someone a message about how much I wish to die tonight and that I wish I had a gun so I could end it quickly. But I feel I'll just hurt them, which is why I posted here. I don't know what I expect to get out of it, but I just want to say something to someone. I can't kill myself tonight, but I wish I could.
