I opened Facebook and started scrolling my own profile looking at old posts. I stumbled across several posts from ex-girlfriend and started thinking about our relationship again and how much I loved her and how much I still love her. I decided to look at her profile and that was a huge mistake. I saw that she is in a relationship with someone new it hurts so much more than I thought it would. It's Like a Knife being driven into my heart all over again. We broke up a little more than a year ago because I'd found that she had been unfaithful. She is the love of my life and I was going to propose to her and now I see so many of my friends in happy committed relationships and I see her being happy again and it just kills me. I've accepted that I'm just going to end up alone for the rest of my life for various reasons. It just hurts so much because of how much I still care for her. Sometimes I wish I could just die and let this all be over with. I wish I could legitimately just end my life so I would never have to see any post from her or hear about her or hear from her or have to talk to anybody about her or my depression ever again. I just want to stop being so fucked in the head.EDIT: You guys are all just so awesome. Thank you all so much for the encouragement. You've given me wisdom in a time where I really needed it. I honestly can't thank you all enough.
