 I feel so sorry for you, I can't imagine how it must be not beeing able to see your own child, that's one of the cruelest thngs i can imagine even. I bet your a good dad and your daughter will thank you when you grow up, it makes me very sad that you can't see her every day, enjoy the quality time you get with her.
