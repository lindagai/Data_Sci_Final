Not afraid of dying either, however I'm still afraid of pain so when I commit suicide I want it to be as painless as possible. I don't want to die a terrifying death either (like being tortured or raped or stabbed to death in some alley... Or some gruesome accident... Awful way to go, imo ). I'd like to die a serene, fully controlled, voluntary death. ðŸ™‚ if  such a thing is possible.
