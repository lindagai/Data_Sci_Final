I feel the exact same way, and I actually have panic attacks when I think about dying.  For a long time I thought I didn't classify as depressed because I wasn't suicidal. I just feel empty. Nothing makes me happy and I'm not passionate about anything. I have no drive to get a job, make friends, or improve my life at all. I *want* all of those things so bad, but when I think about doing anything about it I'm just like... stuck.  You're not alone. Everyone is different, ya know.
