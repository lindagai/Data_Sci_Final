Female, 19years old. I was diagnosed with clinical depression a month ago, I have anxiety issues, need to take pills to sleep and not have sleep paralysis and sometimes I have panic attacks, bad ones... I've been dating my boyfriend for 2 years and 11 months, soon to be 3 years.. I have someone dear to me who is real but I can't meet in Germany, I'm from another country in Europe... I have a art's degree but I have to work in a clothes shop where I'm paid nearly nothing, so I'm not able to leave the hell my house has become, nor go rent a place with my boyfriend or leave everything behind and go meet the person I hold dear to me in Germany.... I'm stuck with things I don't like, I have low self esteem, I find myself most of the time wandering outside my body, the body I've hated for 4 years now and can't leave or seem to be able to change... I tried suiciding twice in my life, one of the times it didn't work, the world was against me and the second time I pussied out, fearing the burden my mother and father would have to bear and for pity of my brother, who had no one else besides me to help him, or keep him company... Ive failed in life, its hard to try to keep it all together but nothing seems to be wording.... I came across this subreddit yesterday.. Maybe here I'll find some hope because I'm running out of everything and no one can help me...
