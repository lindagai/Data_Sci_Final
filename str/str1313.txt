Not what one would consider a solid reason. I could die to save my family  some money. I could die to simply avoid things I hate. I could die because I'm taking the places of others who could make much better use of the resources afforded to me. But I don't have to have a reason to die. I'm not seeking to die. I'm just not going to go out of my way to keep myself alive. If I die, great. If I don't, oh well. I'm more curious than anything.
