So i dont think i have depression so much as it is terrible luck which makes me miserable.But anyway it seems like each time things start to go good for me, everything just topples down and explodes.Each time i think i make a friend they betray me or try to use me. Each time i meet a girl that seems into me, the second i get into it it goes cold. And it seems like when things get like this even video games are against me. Ill be playing battlefield and ill clearly be shooting people before they shoot me but i always die first. And it really pisses me off cause i live in a close vicintiy to all these people so ill run into them all the time. They say things like \"we need to hang out\
