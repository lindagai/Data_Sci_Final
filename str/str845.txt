I thought this year was going to be different.  Me and my boyfriend moved into an apartment together.  We got two cats everything seemed to be looking up.  It was the last semester of my senior year of college and  I was excited and scared.  But, then things started to happen,  both of our cats died from unknown causes about two weeks apart. He surprised me with two more and I had to put one down, while the other one died later in that week.  I had a bad ringworm infection, where I had over 90 large very visible ringworms all over my body. I became highly self conscious. My school work took a turn for the worst.  I did know if I was going to pass or not.  I did and I was able to get a decent part time job.  Things were looking up and we decided to get two more cats,  they were doing well but then one died Wednesday. I'm sick of dealing with so much death.  I'm in a shit ton of debt for a degree that wasn't worth it. I always tried to live for my boyfriend and cats, but I can't do it  anymore. I  can't come home after work and clean and cook while he does nothing. I can't have another cat die.  I want to die or at least I don't want to exist.  I not sure what I want to do,  but all I know is that I'm not happy.
