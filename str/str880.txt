I just turned 20 today and all I can think about is dying right now. I'm at college for summer training for football so I'm 5 hours away from practically everyone I know. I've had depression for 7 years now and it has never been treated even the slightest.  It runs my life for the most because I'm not good at football really and now I'm even worse due to depression and I can't focus. Too depressed to work on school sometimes. I have no interest or passions and I really don't have any talent beyond being bad at everything. I really hate life. I hate college too. I also hated every part of my life so far starting from my childhood until now. I really wish I could die so the pain would finally be over but I know it will never be over. Atleast for now. I wish I had to courage to commit suicide but I don't so I'll just deal with my life and be miserable everyday. I wish my life was different but it's not. I feel lost all the time and I don't know what to do anymore. I don't even feel like coming back to play football in the fall because I'm not on scholarship anyway.  I rather just focus on my grades rather than doing something that's pretty much worthless I guess I don't know. What can I do? I'm so tired of living.
