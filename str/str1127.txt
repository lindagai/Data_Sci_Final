So I am in a very bad place in life right now and it is made worse by my brain constantly obsessing over negative things and causing me to be an anxious mess. Do you any of you here have any tips or advice in handling obsessive thinking? I used to be medicated and it kept them largely under control, but my meds were really bad for me and I had to quit them. I'm kind of scared to try and get back on any other medication so I'm really looking for any kind of non- drug related advice. Thanks!
