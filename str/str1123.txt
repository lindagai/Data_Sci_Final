I am new to TRT, been on for about 1.5 months, I also have add, but been without adderall for about 2 months due to switching doctors. I take 200 mg Every 1st and 3rd Friday,  my original testosterone was at 202.Twice in that time I have come close to killing myself, and tonight I held the razor to my wrist tracing where I would cut.I have cried so many times, I feel so far from the guy I used to be. My wife says she irritated at how much I apologize. I am afraid to talk to her about me killing myself.I get my adderall this Monday. So I hope that will help part of my problem. My next dr. appointment isn't till the 22nd.I'm sorry if this is not the right sub,  just trying to reach out.  I would be greatly embarrassed to talk about  it with my wife or family or friends. Thanks for readingEdit: I talked about it with my wife,  she is helping me through this.  I went and did some yoga today for the first time in years (her suggestion) and she took me to get a hair cut and some new clothes (I have not cared about how I dress in a long time,  and haven't gotten a hair cut in 7 months)The thoughts of suicide are still present,  but they are not like me if that makes sense.  My wife catches me spacing out from time to time today,  and it took about 2 hours to eat dinner.
