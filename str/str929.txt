Guys.  I just don't know where else to turn and I just want somebody to talk to. Around people I feel okay I can forget about how sad I am on the inside.  Sometimes I smoke to make the pain go away.  It's really all I can do.   I just don't know what to-do.  I recently (1year) moved into a new house than my old house.  It's much nicer on the inside but it's not the same.  This house doesn't get internet or anything that isn't dish.  And ever since we moved in I've just been getting sadder and sadder that I can't play any games or download anything.  I can't even watch videos on YouTube it's so bad.  I feel so disconnected from the world and its killing me inside.  I can't keep up with any current events.  I used to also play tons of video games and talk to friends on team speak and I cannot do that anymore.  Ide like to say that I was pretty good at some of the games I put thousands of hours into and I just can't do that anymore.  It's killing me that I can't vent myself.  It drives me crazy at night trying to fall asleep if I even can. Recently I've been having dreams where I kill myself and wake up and I can't keep having these dreams.  I'm just so frustrated.  I can't do this anymore.    I play music and have played guitar for almost a decade and it's starting to not help as much as it did when we first moved in. I just can't figure out a way to vent myself and it's making me so sad inside I can't take it.  I'm sorry for the wall of text.  I just can't motivate myself to even format it right now
