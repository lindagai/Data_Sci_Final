I got a new job but I've missed four days now and in like a week and a half. Couldn't even bring myself to call them, I've made up so many random excuses already I was just too embarrassed to do that again and I don't want to tell them the truth cos... ya know. Feel like I'm wasting my life. I've lost so many jobs it's pathetic
