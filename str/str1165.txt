I recently watched [*The Zero Theorem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Zero_Theorem), and then I re-watched [*Abre Los Ojos*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Your_Eyes_(1997_film) and feel that both films speak to me in a big way although very differently.I feel that Zero Theorem does a fairly good job of describing my external situation, while Abre Los Ojos (nevermind that piece of shit American remake with the Top Gun manlet) in a way describes my inner situation, that feeling of being damaged and living in a fantasy world based on pop and advertisement culture.What are some of the films that you feel capture aspects of your personal situation, either externally or internally (or maybe even both)?
