I know depression makes it hard to remember things in the short term, but I feel like depression changes my memory in a way that I never hear anyone else talk about. After a depressive episode, I feel like everything that occurred before that episode is from the distant past, like in another life, and I have a hard time remembering it or connecting to it. Even after I have fully recovered from the episode.My last episode was during last fall, and even though I got better in the spring, I still feel like I have a hard time recalling my life before the fall. It just feels like everything is so different now, like I moved to a different town, but I didn't.I don't really know how to explain it, but it is just a distinct feeling to me. I am really curious if this happens to other people.Edit: Wow. I did not expect so many replies. I know this is not even remotely the worst aspect of depression (at least for me it isn't), but even after I'm clear of the depression this still haunts me. And I have had to explain to people over and over again that my memory is bad, and I can't really explain why... sometimes it's even hard to convince myself that I'm not just stupid or flakey. But hearing that this happens to so many other people too... I don't know. It sounds cheesy but it just makes me feel like I am really not alone in this. I know there are other people out there who understand. Thank you for your comments :)
