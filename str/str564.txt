Maybe try finding a new doctor and get a second opinion. I did that myself. First doc prescribed cymbalta at a very high dose and it made me very sick. Then I went to a new doc and that has been a much better experience. The first few weeks on prozac I would expect to feel worse. I certainly felt worse for 3 weeks. The side effects should go away. I would not just stop taking it, but I'd consider going back down to 20mg until you've been taking it for a month, then go back up to 40mg. When my doc first talked to me about meds I didn't really want them. I told her that I don't want to just pump myself full of drugs and become a zombie, I wanted to actually deal with the problem. She understood and suggested a therapist in addition to medication. In my experience so far, the med isn't going to make you happy or fix you. What it will do is make you *functional*. I've been out of work for 2 months and haven't felt well enough to go interview. Now I am ready to go find a job and get back out there. I'm still depressed, definitely not a happy person, but I feel like I can function again.
