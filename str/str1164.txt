Life is going kinda bad. I know my problems are nothing compared to others but it just feels sucky. Literally just crying on and off at my computer trying to find some way to make myself feel better. My dumb problems:I draft a lot of magic, lost like 3 or 4 in a row online for little to no reason, just bad luckI think I love this girl, or at least like her a lot. She doesn't really pay too much attention to me and it feels hopeless but I can't get her out of my mind.I am stressed from school and track and etc,etc,etc. Writing this list out makes me feel like my problems are even less significant than I thought and is making me feel worse. Please talk to me anyone.
