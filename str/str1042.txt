Im 18. Me and my mother have been forced to live with her son (my half brother) and his wife, 37 and 40 years old respectively, for more than a year now and we can't stand it. He is an extreme alcoholic and gets drunk every day and slams doors and breaks shit, yells at mum and his wife and spits on them. Hes done some extrme shit too. He's doused the house in petrol and threatened to light it, destroyed mum's car, broke a door down, poured oil on my bed for calling the fucking cops on him and other stuff too. He hasn't paid the internet bill for 9 months so I've been stuck going to my friends house every week. I'm petrified of conflict so I can't stand up to him. He doesn't realise how fucked he is and doesn't care about anyone but himself. He doesn't believe in stress or depression (yep, one of those guys) and goes off if my mum or I are even slightly unhappy. I want to leave but fucking can't, no money to do anything and even if I left, my mother would be stuck there with him and that'd be hell for her. I can't do this shit anymore. I can't live every day wondering what the Fuck I'll be coming "home" to. I've already had one kidney removed due to high blood pressure damage because of stress. What's next, death? To be honest, I don't even mind
