Unfortunately I can't really describe what depression feels like other than it felt like a whole lot of nothing. It felt like walking down a dark hallway into the blackness ahead and you keep walking and keep walking and through the windows of the rooms you pass you see people outside doing normal people things and you keep walking and keep walking trying to find a door to get out to those people, but it's just black, that's all you're walking into. You don't know what's going on and you watch as the people start moving away farther and farther from the window and you're yelling, telling them to wait up, but they can't hear you so you start to run, but you're lost and you don't know what you're doing exactly except you need to run because you'll find a way out if you just run and you run until your legs hurt and you're out of breath and then you see that the people are still moving further and further away, smiles on their faces, talking to each other and you slow down but it's still dark ahead of you. Depression is hard to deal with and I couldn't blame anybody for leaving. I remember I couldn't even imagine a future, only seeing no futher past a week of existence as if I'd die next week. You're a good friend for sticking around like that, most people don't.I find it pretty funny that I said I couldn't describe it, but end up describing it anyway.
