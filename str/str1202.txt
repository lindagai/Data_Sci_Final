It's not a huge, dramatic thing. But I just want someone to listen and give me their opinion on things.I don't have a lot of friends. I have a lot of acquaintances, but you can't really bring these kinds of things up to those people, can you?This will be the second time we've broken up. We dated for 6 months last year, he broke up with me because of his depression and then he immediately wanted me back. By that time though, I had begun to see the problems in our relationship. So I said no.I was a mess for quite a while after we broke up. So was he.He dated someone. I didn't. After they broke up, we mutually agreed to give it another shot. Well we tried, and he seems to think everything is going swell. But I have a lot of doubts about him, and I know I will eventually break up with him. I've just been figuring out when and how to do it. There are some things you just can't say to someone who you love.
