Throughout high school, my life was worthless, always has been, always will be, but there was one subject I didn't fail at, accounting. Not great at it, didn't understand why I screwed it up, but I understood it. So I decided my life would be, finish school, go to uni, do accounting, die. I wrote that down every day, that's all that mattered, I'd never be happy, but I may as well try and do that.Needless to say, that didn't happen, in my second year I'd grown isolated and attempted suicide, I'd failed many courses and barely passed the others. I took time off, I tried to work, I tried to make friends, try and make my life good enough I could focus, after 5 years, I finished everything but my electives, which I'm not really able to do. I contemplate and call suicide hotlines daily, I have no one to talk to and absolutely nothing has made me happy in the past 4 years. Suicide is the only option I have for contentment, I will suffer for as long as I live.Who the fuck is going to hire an obese, unlikeable, friendless worthless person who fucked their life up and will probably die next week? Why the fuck am I doing this when it will never get me anywhere. You'd be better off hiring a fucking 3 year old than employing me. I'm just not good enough, never will be, and I'm so tired of living this lie.
