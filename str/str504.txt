Amen.Everything you said makes so much sense in my life too. \"That's the most harmful thing to do for depressed people, to make a cookie cutter version of how depressed people look and act.\" This. I'm really pissed when people do this. I want to tell them that they are wrong but some people are just blinded in their own \"strong, happy\" personality that they would just shoot me down as being a pessimist.
