That's rough Sorry to hear about it, i know you have probably tried this but what about family and friends that you can stay at? In replacement for meds not sure if it will help but try to work on some skills to help wether it be breathing, yoga/meditation or counting methods. Keep trying for a job and hopefully you get one soon, being positive and hopfull is a good thing keep it up and it will start rolling soon. As for the gf thats harsh and i truley am deeply sorry that has happend. Maybe start doing physical exercise as it has been shown to improve mental and physical condition in the body. If you can start rashing food as in have a snack every 2-3 hours and drink plenty of water look up cost effective foods that are healthy as well as filling eg soups/rice dishes. Hope this helps they are suggestions to what id do in the circumstances.
