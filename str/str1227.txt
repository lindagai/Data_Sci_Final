I want to kill myself, but I know that's a lie, even if I can't get that thought out of my head.What I care about more is that we're alking about it, so you're not actually weighing me down; I want to know how you're feeling, I'm not just being nice. I need to tell you that I'm depressed too, it's what helps keep me alive.
