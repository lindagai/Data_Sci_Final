Personally I think [this guy's](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxhpvoVGjv1r9w9mso1_500.jpg) nose is on point. the nose bridge is thin, prominent, uniform, and strong and it flairs out perfectly. well defined alar creases.But [this guy](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BPfIdo0CAAEbrdV.jpg:large) is also considered attractive, but his nose isn't as well defined. while it has the same level of prominence the radix has more skin around it. and the flair is poorer than the first. the ala and corresponding ala creases aren't as conspicuous as the first mans'. [now this guy](http://a398.idata.over-blog.com/708x958/2/24/40/32/Jeudi-19-Juillet-2012/Sean-O-Pry.jpg) has a prominent radix which is ideal but again the alar creases aren't well defined. to me that looks poor but i was wondering what you guy's think. to me [this](https://www.shapiroplasticsurgery.com/wp-content/uploads/images/main_images/male-face_sub2.jpg) is the ideal facial aesthetics except for the nose (though it is very close). I told the plastic surgeon that these are the jawline and cheekbone implants i'd like but of course the nose has to match. so i'm curious what you guys think is the ideal nose.
