Hello everyone, I've been dealing with my depression for a while and I felt maybe I should share it and have someone's objective opinion about it. I woke up today like I normally do, but this was one of my mornings where I had my depression really kick in and nothing but thoughts of suicide would fill my head. I just don't want to bother anyone any more. I wanted to go away and don't bring anything negative to anyone's lives again. I'm 21 year old male living in the US, immigrated from Poland when I was a child and currently attend a university. My depression started when my mother passed away when I was 11. Since then I've had more nights where I fell asleep wishing I wouldn't wake up than with a smile on my face. I didn't want to kill myself because it would be cruel to my father, and later my girlfriend for me to do so. My father passed away less than  a year ago. And now I'm really setting myself up for ending my life. I stopped being a 3.5+gpa students, not doing homework, not participating in class etc.. Broke up with my girlfriend hoping she would find a guy who would make her happy, and that doesn't have  a messed up life nor mind. I started to push away all my friends and only talk to a few now. I doubt I'll have finacial aid to pay for school, I'm slowly having less and less friends and I don't have anyone significant in my life (no family) and once I manage to push all my friends away no one would be left to care. So what reason do I have not to continue this. Why should I believe life isn't going to get worse and worse. I just want to go away and not be a bother. I don't want people to know about  my depression because it's such a burden, or at least not experience it with me. I want to simply die completely. My body rotting away and my name never mentioned/remembered after i die. If I manage to be forgotten, then why not suicide?
