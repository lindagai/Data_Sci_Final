But the more practical definition of cynical has always been a part of me. I tear down and dismiss most things in life as being stupid or malicious, including people. But now that there's a person, a girl, that I actually like in my life, this dog-like-ness is really how I start to see myself. Dirty, ineloquent, dull. I guess I've become pretty cynical toward myself.I guess the word refers to how you see what you are seeing rather than how you yourself are. Good people are sometimes so good that I feel bad and unfit to be with them. It's a different kind of pain being like Eeyore next to a Tigger. I'm grateful for the positive people of the world, (I know lots of people would love to have one of them in their lives) but I needed to say that depression doesn't just fly away when I meet these people.Sometimes genuinely great people are more like a wake up call for me, inciting a huge self-loathing spiral.
