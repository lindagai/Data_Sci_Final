I cut relatively regularly because it helps keep me from being suicidal but ive noticed recently I dont feel the pain as much, which makes me want to go deeper and do more of them. The unsettling thought part was that I've noticed that whenever my family leaves the house I almost always think something along the lines of 'If I slit my wrists now I could be dead by the time they get back' or late at night something along the lines of 'If I overdose now I could be dead by morning.' The part that unsettles me is that I used to quickly go against those thoughts and list reasons I need to live and such, but recently I've noticed that I haven't really argued with those urges, I just try to keep myself from moving towards my blades or my family's pills. Sorry if this was a bit jumbled or confusing. Thanks for listening, any advice?
