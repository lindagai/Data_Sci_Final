My whole life ive been such an asshole to everyone i knew. I'm untrusting, I absolutely hate people i dont know personally, and even if i do know them personally theres a little bit of hate.A little while ago, my mom who recently had hip surgery fell on the concrete, about half an hour ago. i've been bawling my eyes out ever since she was taken by the ambulance, and i absolutely despise myself for the way i treated her.I never did the simple chores she asked me to do. the dishes, clean the cat box, little shit like that. occasionally id do it, but id always refuse, but now that she actually has fallen, and probably REALLY hurt herself, i just want to die knowing how much of a fucking prick i was to her. I regret it all. I love my mom, i don't know why im such an asshole.. i fucking hate myself for how badly i treated her..
