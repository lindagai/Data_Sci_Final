I've had 3 interviews and the 3rd interview hired me on the spot. I start in a couple days and hopefully it won't be as bad as I think it will be because of my SA. Last 2 interviews I could tell my SA made me act awkward and that's probably why I didn't get the job. I saw what I did wrong in the last 2 and forced myself not to make those same mistakes again in this one and it worked. I'm 17 btw.
