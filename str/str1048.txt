My depression has never been treatable, I've tried a bunch of different SSRIs, SNRIs, lithium, depakote, trazodone, etc, etc. Nothing helps, except cannabis does temporarily, and helps me sleep, but it's not a cure or anything. It's not something chemical, it's something that's at the core of my being, part of my personality.   I feel like I'm going to die soon, but I've felt this way for a while. I'll be making dinner, and just start getting sad because my youngest son, who is only 1 y/o will never get to know me because I'll be dead.I have some suicidal ideation, but no real attempts, unless you count not caring about my health and things like that. Suicide's not really an option, I have three kids. It also affects my life. why try hard and succeed if I'm just going to die soon? I'm a pretty rational person, so I know this isn't necessarily the case, as I'm 38 years old now, and this has been going on for a long time.   It affects jobs, which I hate and start to feel like they're pointless in the grand scheme of things. It affects relationships, alcohol abuse, health, everything. I have always wanted to be a writer, but I hate everything I write and destroy it. I just can't seem to shake it.I don't know, I don't have a question, just seeing if anyone is similar to me.
