First of all, sorry about any grammar or spelling mistakes i'm actually brazilian and i'm also pretty high from sleeping meds.I'm terrible with time and dates but i'm pretty sure i haven't eaten or drink in 3 days and i don't feel as bad as i'm supposed to be?I dont know if its because ive been taken a lot of sleeping/pain meds, mostly clomipramina, dorflex and alprazolam, so im sleeping a lot and not feeling much hunger.and i also end up drinking the minimum of water necessary to swallow the pills, but it was very little barelly counts as a gulp of water.should i try yo crunch and sniff the pills instead to stop with the water, will they work like that? i heard some people do that with adhd meds.i do feel weaker, and sometimes is hard walking but again, im full of pain meds...and im aware it will be painful as fuck more to the end but im too afraid of heights to jump, and no other method i researched has a good percentagem of sucess, except for guns but we have rigorous gun control here in brazil so it would be impossible for me to buy one, unless i go to a favela look for some drug lord and they would be way too expensive and i just dont have the money. also, i dont want to get raped lolidek what my question here is, just like if anyone tried to go throught that and how the steps went. most sites have very different accounts, specially the pro-life ones, but i dont trust those motherfuckers.
