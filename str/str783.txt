Im 16, and i met this girl through a friend, and we instantly hit it off. I have a long history of dealing with depression but never actually harming myself or anything, just sitting at my desk playing video games trying to numb the loneliness and pain. But this girl changed all of that, she made me feel happy, alive, and like a real human again. We were together for almost a month until i get a text saying that we should split up, we talked for a total of about 8 hours that day, she had cheated on me for an ex, but it wasn't sex or anything so i wasn't immensely bugged. But then that following night i started to get paranoid, i wasn't sure if she would leave me or not because she just said she wanted to take a bit of a break to sort things out, so i started to spam her with texts, beg for her back and typical crazy shit. She didn't talk to me for 3 days, and up until today i had been having a mental breakdown every night, trying to cut myself, crying immensely  and today i finally got in touch with her, only to have my friend tell me that she was making out with her ex again. I broke down, i broke things, i screamed and freaked out and cried, and that was only 40ish minutes ago. To add to all that, my grandmother is currently on life support and is probably going to dieI have a semi history with getting paranoid and everything i try to do just doesn't help. So reddit, what do i do? I feel like i just want to die, i feel like without someone there for me i'm going to rot because my life has been so horrid for as long as i can remember. This feels like rock bottom, and i don't see any further reason to continue living in this shithole, i've been depressed since i was atleast 14, now almost 3 years later it feels like i haven't gotten any better. I just want her back, it feels like shes the only one who can help me.
