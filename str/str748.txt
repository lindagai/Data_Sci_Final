I don't even like being drunk. What the fuck am I supposed to do. Every option I have looks to be terrible, and I have literally every option imaginable. I can have anything and yet I want nothing. I can do anything and yet I just lay here and wallow in my depression. I wish I could give my privileges to someone who would actually want them, someone who has passion. I just want to die.
