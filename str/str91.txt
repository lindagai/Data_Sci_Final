Depending on where you live, there could be sliding scale counseling services. I go to a sliding scale counseling service and finally found the most supportive and amazing counselors I have ever had.  Check around if you can find one like that.  I'm sorry you are feeling lonely, I know how you feel. My best friends moved to Boston and Washington and I feel that same loneliness. I hope you are able to reach out to new people and find some more friends.
