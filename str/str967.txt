I'm so tired of depression.  I used to love playing video games before my depression consumed my life. Now I can't even play a few matches in Hearthstone (Or any game) without getting bored or beyond pissed off for no reason. Gaming used to be the best outlet I had, because you could do anything you wanted with no real life consequences.  It's like someone pulled a veil over my eyes and made the things I used to enjoy stupid and childish. I'll flip through a gaming magazine and put it down because titles that I used to care about I couldn't care less for now.  I just want to have fun and relax and unwind. Living on a tight budget makes doing enjoyable activities hard enough, but now I don't even have fun doing something that used to help me. What's the point of doing something if you no longer get enjoyment out of it?  I'm so tired of living like this. I just want to be happy and have fun and be normal. But instead I'm a miserable shit who doesn't do anything but look at Reddit all day.
