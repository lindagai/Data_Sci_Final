First things first, I'm a 24-year old office lady from the Philippines. I was diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder last January.My shrink told me that laziness and procrastination keeps me from being sociable and productive at work but I feel like there's really something wrong with me. Like I'm defective or something. I'm forced to make phone calls at work. I tried my darndest to make those calls but it always comes out as a harrowing experience because every time I call someone, I vomit words. It'a just making phone calls [I can do fine with making calls to close friends or family but strangers? I can't]. Everyone can do it but I can't seem to do it. I know there are a lot of people like me out there but I'm surrounded by normal people who don't have problems with socializing and I feel so alone. I also live in a country where mental health is just shunned aside as a minor problem. I feel tired. Tired with trying to keep up with the demands of work. Tired of being forced to talk to people. Tired of conforming to what society wants me to do, but I can't show it. I have to put up a fake front and pretend that I'm fine. I have to suck it up. Heck, that's what everyone tells me to do.I don't even know if I'm making any sense right now. To the person who reads this, sorry if I wasted your time.
