Hey all,A thought that's been on my mind as someone who struggles with chronic depression and anxiety is, it's difficult to know where to draw the line between giving my body and mind what it needs (self-care) and giving in to cravings and petty desires. It feels so easy to enable myself to make splurge purchases or \"treat myself\" to a pastry for breakfast instead of fueling my body with something nutritious. I've quit more than one job without having another lined up because I felt as though I couldn't endure another day without a major breakdown. I want to find the boundaries of self-care. I want to be able to function in the world, function in the workplace, be present and happy in my friendships, be there for my partner and be there for myself. Has anyone else struggled with finding this kind of balance? Please share your stories!
