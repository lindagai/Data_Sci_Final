I was just about to post asking if there are any "older" people on here. You and I are in the same boat. My 38th birthday is coming up and I want to die as much as I did twenty five years ago. I am tired of people telling me to hang on it'll get better. Really? They have no idea what it is like to be in this much pain for decades. I have been well for a few months scattered in those decades. Sometimes I think I could look forward to a respite.
