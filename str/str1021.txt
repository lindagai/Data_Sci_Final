Some of you have put into words exactly what I'm feeling.  No one in my family understands.  They just tell me to "snap out of it".  My son tells me to go see some one,  but I wouldn't know what to say if I did.  I feel like I shouldn't feel this way.  I have what I need,  but I still feel this deep depression.  I don't know what to do.  I just want to disappear,  or die in my sleep.  I don't think I can kill myself,  because it would hurt people.  I never want to hurt anyone.
