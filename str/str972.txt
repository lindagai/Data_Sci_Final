I feel so pathetic and useless. I have no friends and no stable job. Even though I worked really hard in college and got awards every year, people who slacked off or didn't even finish college have better jobs than me because I'm socially awkward and people just don't like me the moment they see me. I hate myself for being like this but I also don't know how I'm supposed to change because whenever I try to act more outgoing it feels so fake and makes me look even more awkward. I'm not wanted by anyone and my existence doesn't even matter. When I try to be friendly with other people they always have another friend who they like more and it's like I'm not even needed. So over time I stopped trying altogether and don't bother to push myself to socialize with others anymore. I often think about how I could literally drop dead right now and nobody would care, except for maybe my parents but they'd be relieved that a useless and shameful child like me is gone. I want to end my life but I'm a coward who's afraid of death and that's just another thing that makes me pathetic. All I can do is continue to feel miserable as I hover between life and death and it's so hard to get through every day
