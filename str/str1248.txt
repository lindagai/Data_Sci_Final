Literally exactly the same situation. I talked to her about it last night about how it literally kills me to know that she'll never look at me the way I look at her and she sinply said that she doesn't know what to say. It's so fucking painful to know that i'll never be more than a friend and i'll never be able to hold her, hug her, or kiss her.It's the definte cause for why I think about suicide every day and for why i'm hopelessly depressed.
