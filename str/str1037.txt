Normal people are born to enjoy their happy (though, meaningless and short) lives. However, I am defective and no pleasant life is possible for me! I don't understand: it can't be for my own sake that I want to die (how do I observe the fulfillment of my intention?). But I don't see any other way around. It's so bitter. Why hasn't something heavy fallen on me from a roof already? Why wouldn't just everything disappear in a global cataclysm?
