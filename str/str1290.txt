I really feel for you, man.  I've been in a similar state of mind and honestly I have no specific trick on how I got out of it (mostly) other than time.  (But keep in mind that I'm not you and some of this may not apply.)Looking back, tl;dr my thoughts were so self-destructive and I experienced a lot of what you described.  I was so so hopeless for the future and the answer to everything in my life was suicide and every thought I had would lead to thinking about suicide.  But that train of thought won't last forever!!  After a long time, the cycle started to slowly break, I guess?  I was able to see through my own thoughts and how illogical many of them were.  I started finding myself stopping myself in the middle of a thought.  I don't know how to describe it exactly but I literally was not thinking logically when I was there mentally.  Now, going back through my thought processes from then, I constantly think "Wait a second, that doesn't make sense" or "But there's so much evidence against that" or "That's completely untrue".  (Of course, I'm not you so I don't know your specific train of thought so specific examples probably wouldn't be helpful.)  But I know that this "limbo" won't last forever.  Please please please don't give up.  When I was really suicidal, I thought I wouldn't regret it in the future if I didn't kill myself.  That it would last like that forever and I'd never improve.  Today I realize how fucking wrong I was.  Depression still fucks me up and I'm still getting back on my feet but I'm not suicidal anymore and I'm so so so so so happy that I didn't kill myself.  You just gotta keep keeping on.  It'll get better and it will go away, I promise.  (Sorry this got so long and ramble-y agh...)
