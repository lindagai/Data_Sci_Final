I'm homeless, trans, and depressed. I live in a youth shelter (I'm 20) in an area I'm not that familiar with. I've been here since February and I still haven't made a single friend in the area. No family, no friends (at least no one is ever around). Scheduled to be on testosterone in about 3 weeks. No income. This is taking a toll on my physical health, I can tell. I feel sick almost every day. I had a week where I broke out in hives from stress alone. My hair has been falling out. Skin problems. I can barely make it out of bed, much less leave the house. And it's even harder to put in the energy to leave the house when I don't even have anything to do when I'm out. I've tried so many meds and while the one I'm on now (Effexor) helps a little it's clearly not good enough. I have a therapist, but even she doesn't know how to get me friends. I don't want to live like this anymore. I have tried everything (volunteering, meetups, the library...) and I just can't make friends. Online friends do nothing to make me feel better. My family was abusive and I've never felt loved or accepted. I don't know what's wrong with me but I can't do this anymore.
