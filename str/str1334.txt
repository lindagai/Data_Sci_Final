TL;DR: Yes, I do. Every day.More elaborately, depression runs in my family and unfortunately it didn't pass over me. Every day has its ups and downs and its usually in my down moments that I have these thoughts. What if I were to just jump into traffic on the highway? What if I were to take the entire bottle of pills on my table and OD? It's frightening in that these thoughts just come naturally even though the impulse isn't really there. It's just that haunting What If?, that idea that I could do it at any time, and easily too. From my bedroom I can identify without thinking about it at least 3 ways that I could off myself and I know there are easily many more if I really tried, but the impulse to go through with them isn't there. But I digress.For people like us that have these issues, yeah I'd say it's pretty normal. But I'm not a doctor
