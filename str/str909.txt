Dear mom, I'm sorry I've been a bad sonI get it. I'm 19 and I'm still living off your dime, you expect me to be able to handle taking care of the house, to be an active participant in family activities.Truth is, I don't care anymore. You're right, I'm angry. Angry at the world, myself, everything. I'm just an angry person. I want to be gone just as much as you want me to be, however I don't think you and I would agree on what gone means in that context. I'm tired of living and just wish it would be over already, I'm walking in the dark with no idea of what or where I'm supposed to be going to, and if there is no real end goal then what's the point in even trying. I just want to fade away from here, and I'm holding out for that.However you know at least some of this. You know I have depression, you know I'm bipolar and get mood swings, you know I have extreme anxiety. I may be obese, I'm working on that, but my mind is in way far worse shape right now, the progress I've been making in therapy is waning again, and this is why. You don't know, but I'm planning on packing a bag and taking a hike when I finish that CD I've been spending while days in my garage. I'll do is both a favor and find my own hole to die in. But I do love you very much. Sometimes I myself don't feel like people care what I think or feel either, and I'm not so sure you care. That makes me sad, very sad. Now if only I could tell her even half of this.
