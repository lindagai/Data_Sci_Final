Are you me?! Seriously though, same feelings except I am a girl and in a relationship. Recently I've stopped pretending to be happy around my SO and things have taken a turn for the worse. He knew I was depressed, but didn't realize how often I pretended I was OK. Now I don't have the energy to wear a mask around him. If I feel like curling up in a ball &amp; not talking, I do it. I'd kill myself too but I'm too much of a wimp. I think about doing it every day.
