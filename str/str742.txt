So a bit about me. I'm ugly. Maybe not jaw-dropping vomit-inducing ugly, but a solid 3-4/5. And not 'oh you're fat and need to lose weight' ugly or 'get a haircut, buy some new clothes ugly.' I'm a bit over normal weight, quite muscular, and know how to dress well though I gave up on it long ago because there's no point. A few years ago, I was body-wise, close to perfect: 13% body fat, six pack, blah blah blah. Never mattered for shit. I'm short. I've got a big head and a wide face and acne scars. And the reality is that this makes finding a life partner almost impossible. Because I have to get rejected hundreds of times before I get a date, and frankly I don't have time for that shit.People will give me the 'it's personality and confidence that counts' talk. That's utter horseshit. The only people who say that are beautiful people who are only ever held back by their personalities. Believe me, that charming, hilarious, smart, caring ugly guy you know get's rejected all the time. I know, because that's me.I don't blame people (in my case women) for only caring about looks in romance. But I don't know that I can keep on living alone. I'm so tired of coming home to a cat and an empty bed. I'm so tired of watching money pile up in my bank account knowing I'll never get to spend it on a family. I'm tired of watching my beautiful friends and their happy fucking significant others.I'm thinking about killing myself, just to free the world of the burden of another ugly face, another genetic mistake. I wish my parents had never had me. I keep flickering between hatred for the world and hatred for myself. I might as well just end it now because I'm so damn worn out with trying.
