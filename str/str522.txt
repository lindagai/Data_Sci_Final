Hello! I'm in the same boat but severely underweight (woo starvation self harm) and aromantic &amp; asexual so I'll pass on that whole \"love\" thing thanks haha. I wonder if apathy and being unable to get a job makes us think about how immortality would go, cause I think about it too.These days I only feel good about being sucessful in games, or interacting with the few friends I have, other than that its anxiety with family or complete apathy. 0 motivation for anything ._.What do?
