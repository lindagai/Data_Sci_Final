I am starting to get worried.. I have gone years of feeling the way I feel and only gotten help last year, but I cannot live with this feeling constantly inside of me. I am begging anyone to help me I cannot feel like this I am suffering every single day I live and I am so alone and All I fucking do is get high or drunk every single night I can to avoid the pain but its unbearable. I would not wish this on my worst enemy I swear I wouldn't its unbearable It really fucking is. I am never truly happy and I never have been no one fucking cares about me and I am going no where in life. FUCKING LEAVE ME ALONE DEPRESSION I HATE MYSELF BECAUSE OF YOU AND ILL NEVER BE HAPPY BECAUSE OF YOU. I want to be happy I really do its all I want. Wish I had self esteem or pride in myself or anything. I am tired of taking these antidepressant pills and relying on alprazolam almost everyday.  I don't know how you all do it. The pain is too much and the pain is truly unexplainable. I feel constantly down, never happy, numb to any positive emotions, depressed, sick, worthless and so much fucking more. Nobody would care if I never woke up tomorrow. Nobody would.
