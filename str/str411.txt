No matter how you feel you are never alone in this! People like me will always be around to help, love, and support you. Therapy has certainly helped me as has certain prescribed medications. Definitely see someone if you feel you need it and they can prescribe a treatment. Also, always remember life is worth living. Life is truly a gift and sometimes it may not seem that way. Life can be brutal and can kick you when you're down, unfortunately there is true pain and suffering in the world. But life is still worth living because it can be joyous and wonderful too! Even if you are feeling bad now, who's to say what you'll feel like down the road. You could have a great job, family, husband, etc. Don't let life tear you down, it isn't about being happy all the time, it's about getting back up when you've been knocked down. God bless you!
