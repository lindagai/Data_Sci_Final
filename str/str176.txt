If you need help with online dating then I'm here with the Duder's Dating Decisions!  (lol, but really!)Dating online is much, much different than asking a woman out in person because it's not some instant in-person answer. Things take time.**Profile Name**Pick something neutral, **do not** include 69, 420, gaming, your birthday year or something that leads me to believe you're sad/depressed. **Pictures**I don't care if you don't like taking pictures, if you want to go out on dates then you need three or four solid pictures of yourself. You need to smile (with or without teeth showing) and be fully clothed. This can be at work, in your backyard, doing one of your hobbies, etc!  Just look like you'd be approachable man! :)**Profile**It is **VERY** important that you DO NOT talk down on yourself. DO NOT talk about anxiety, depression. This isn't about being anxious, depressed, sad, shy, awkward. It's about leaving a positive message, you want her to feel good when she reads your profile. If you were browsing through profiles and were looking at a woman, would you be interested if she mentioned things weren't going so well for her? Start an intro paragraph with your name and what you do, what you're studying, what your hobbies are. I know it's different from site to site (such as pof.com or okcupid.com). I can go more in depth about this later if you link me your profile.**Sending Messages**It's once again **VERY** important that you're not aggressive. What I mean by aggressive is: asking for her phone number in the three to five messages you send back and forth to each other (don't move too fast), don't send sexually charged messages, don't appear sad or desperate.I created another paragraph simply for boring messages that just too general for women. Don't say things like, \"Hey! What's up?\
