I guess that depends on what your purpose was. For me it's stay safe while I'm depressed, and on the rare times I'm not depressed, use that time to better my ability to deal with depression and try and be there for others. I don't see how that can end, asides from me dying.  If a purpose is finite and runs out, then I guess it's a case of picking one that makes to you.
