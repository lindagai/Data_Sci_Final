I have officially given up. I don't want this fucking life anymore, it's not worth living. I'm $30,000 in debt at the ripe age of 20, all because of a school I'm about to fail out of. I don't have enough money to do anything. I can't pay my bills, i can't put gas in my car, i don't even have enough money to get a cheeseburger off the dollar menu at fucking McDonalds. I have insurance but they don't help with anything. When inquiring about help getting counseling i was basically told to suck it up and deal with it or pay for whatever myself. I can't seem to do either so I've given up. On life, on living, on accomplishing anything in my worthless life. The 20 years i was given should be returned and given to someone who actually matters or someone who makes a difference to people. All that's left now is to lay in bed and starve. Peace out world, i fucking hated every minute of the time i spent here
