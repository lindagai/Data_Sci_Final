Tomorrow I have the most important exam of my life. Not only for my education, but also for myself. I've decided if I fail, that it ends for me, I'll kill myself. Morale and motivation was high, but the closer I get to the exam, the more the old beast of depression starts to play up. Now I'm feeling again like there isn't even a point in trying.
