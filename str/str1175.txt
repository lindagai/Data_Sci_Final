So I was just sitting in my room playing a game with some friends and my left hand suddenly like felt really slow or detached, it only lasted a moment, but I freaked out super bad and my chin like hightened up when I freaked out, and I just majorly freaked out...Has anyone else experienced anything like this? I'm 21 I've been having awful anxiety since I quit smoking and most of my symptoms are all twitches/spasms, but never anything like that and it onset a pretty bad Panic attack, I've been nicotine free for about a month, if that matters, and I can't find anything googling, I just need some closure I cannot afford the call a doctor right now... and have been trying to just dismiss everything as anxiety because I haven't experienced anything like this since I quit...
