It's not like i'm going to do it though. I guess I don't have the guts. But still, my life feels meaningless, boring... I'm always sad and I feel like im useless and I feel no more pleasure with most of the things I used to. Sometimes it feels like alcohol is the only thing that keeps me from having these thoughts. My life is really shitty. And the worse thing is: I don't want to live. I don't want a better life. I look around and see the world I'm stuck in, and it makes me feel sick. I don't believe in god neither I do in myself. All I want is to die, but I won't. And that's horrible. I feel like a lunatic, because I'm always hoping some robber try to steal from me (Brazil is having lots of these) and I tell him: "You can just kill me."Sorry for the poor writing.
