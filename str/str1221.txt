I hope this finds you okay. I went through something similar when I was that age. I am 25 now. My mother was super religious my whole life and we were always involved in this super strict cult. By the age of 8 or 9 I was depressed because I was alot smarter than alot of people in the cult and I had lost all of my friends, my step dad was super creepy bordering on child abuse and my dad was cut out of my life. I tried to kill myself by taking as many pills as I could. Luckily I only took a bottle full of Advil or Tylenol or something and just got a tummy ache. Continued on hating school they never taught us anything relevant and can you imagine my rage when I found out I wouldnt be getting my diploma because the school isnt recognized by my province(stupud cult school) no friends at school. I was rediculously intelligent but there was no where for me to go with this cult. No options to explore my intelligence. I was expected to get married and pop out a thousand children for this stupid cult. I started doing everything I could to get thrown out. Sex drugs alcohol all underage Eventually I did and was excommunicated (which was another stresser) ended up getting thrown out. Then pregnant a year later. Then I was so messed up about all of that ended up spiralling into a uncontrollable drunken state for a year or two and got raped. Ive never really had complete control of my life and I feel even less so now. But I realize that high school ended. Those horrible people are gone from my life. I dont live with my horrible parent anymore and I have complete control over weither or not my life will get bettet or worse now. All I can say is that in about 2 years you'll be free. And yes high school is the shittiest place in the world but it ends and your closer to the end than the beginning. Stay on the pills. The right pills make all the difference. But I completely understand how much highschool crushes your soul and makes people aches for the end.
