I don't know how to start this, so I will just start. I need help figuring out what is happening.I will describe what I feel to the best of my knowledge. I have been having very, very, bad days in the last weeks. I am in a quite good moment in my life and I can not pinpoint any reason why I feel the way I feel. It comes unannounced, with no triggers as far as I know, I will just feel sad, hopeless, feeling really bad, almost sick. In a hour or two it will go away and I will feel well, just for it to happen again during the day (usually 3x times). I never felt so sad and hopeless as when that happens.I am not looking for a "prescription", I just want some insights or directions of what it can be so I can look for professional help.Keep being strong mates.Tl;dr: does depression comes in waves during the day? As in 3 small black holes of hopelessness and fear? I thought it might be anxiety but there isn't much to be anxious about. I thought it could be bipolar but I don't have something like mania, I just go back to a normal/somewhat-tired-self. Could it be something related to hormones/some disease? PS: when I am very tired, low blood pressure, hangover, it gets even worse, but it will happen everyday regardless
