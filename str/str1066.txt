I am good-looking (something I'd never appreciated until now) and popular (something that had never happened before). I have hundreds of friends from across the world. If I were to kill myself now, I'd be burned into the memories of everyone I know as an angelic and likeable 20 year old forever. If I wait another 20 years, no one will care.In particular I can't help thinking of all the girls I know who would be genuinely devastated if anything happened to me now. They most likely won't be in the future. I like the idea of being missed forever.I know I shouldn't think like this, but I cant help it. If I'm going to commit suicide, which is an inevitability, why not at my peak?
