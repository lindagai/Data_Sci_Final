I mean...why should I? It's not like I can avoid it. My life has been nothing but a pointless slog, and death will put an end to that. Maybe I'll be reincarnated. That would be great. Even though I could end up with a shittier life, the thought of getting to 'roll the dice' again and live as someone else is pretty comforting.Or maybe atheists are right, and there's nothing. Well...'nothing' also means that there's no pain.Fuck...it's sad. The thought of *not existing* sounds better than continuing to live as the sad, pathetic, waste of potential that I am. I'm not exactly suicidal, but I just don't...I don't care about my life anymore. I hate who I used to be, who I am, and I'll probably hate who I will become. I want to move on. I want to see what's next.I thought about it, and if I were to die in an accident soon, it wouldn't bother me that much. Simply put, I have no value on my own life. It's just wasting space.(I apologize for the strange wording and any errors that might be there. I'm on mobile, and I just needed to get this off my chest.)
