I think about suicide a lot, and if I were to be messed up to the point where I'd do it, I'd know what to do and how to do it, but I just can't. I think I best described it in one of my earlier posts: &gt; Having parents that would be upset if you died are the bars of the cage. If my parents weren't in the picture, I don't know what would happen. It's like your being forced to suffer because if you end it, then others have to suffer.&gt;Fuck depression and everything about it. Nobody asked for this. Nobody, as young kids with aspirations and dreams, saw themselves wanting to end their pathetic shitty fucking life that has zero future because they can't take it anymore. I certainly didn't.&gt;I wish there was a way to just respectfully disappear.
