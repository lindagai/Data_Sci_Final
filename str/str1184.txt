I'm not in a great place lately, and I suspect it's because I can't cardio due to a knee injury so I'm "just" doing yoga.  The progress is good, I'm more flexible and getting stronger, but my brain..my brain isn't happy.So I'm curious.  Is it that way for everyone else?  Or is there one particular workout that helps your brain more than the others?
