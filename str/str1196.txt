I kinda envy you guys, most of you are FA probably because of looks or you're shy and you feel like you're FA because you simply have no GF (I don't have one too! surprise!) I am pretty ugly too but the reason I'm always going to be alone is that I have no goals in life, nothing interests me, I have no ambitions as a person, in 20 days I start my first year at an university (IT computer networks) and I have literally zero interest in it. At least some of you have something that gets you out of the bed in the morning, something you work at and improve at, I would LITERALLY kill to have something likt that. I have no hobbies too (other than playing video games and browsing internet all day ofc). I'm not really good at anything, I will probably fail the first year at university and will have to look for some shitty minimum wage job that I will work at till the end of my life. When I'm reading this subreddit I feel like I can't really relate with anyone. People with life goals or ambitions will at least have a decent/good paying job and that attracts women too (self-reliance, ability to support a family, someone who lives to achieve something is much more attractive than a parasyte who works just to eat, sleep and shit). All of that and I'm only 20 yo, everyone I know just has so much stuff they enjoy doing that they cannot decide which one to choose. I don't know where I'm going with that post anymore, I guess it's a vent or something, anyone like me? there are probably a lot of people like me, right?
