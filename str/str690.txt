Relationship lasted 4 years but fell apart over the course of 2 weeks. Decided to delete her and try to move on since it was pretty brutal. I was doing fine but I was hanging on to hope that she still has feelings for me. After about 2 months of no contact i recontact with her. It was going great until we talked about the actual break up and me deleting her. After enough talking i get it out of her thats he has a new boyfriend who ended up being the guy i was paranoid about. I get bitter and say a bunch of shit out of anger to spite her. Apologize shortly after but the damage is done, and i feel like i burned a bridge down. I broke down crying and she told me I have to go away so i said what i had to say and deleted her again. I'm redoing the heartbreak but this time i have no hope to latch onto so I just really feel like giving up. I can't get any food into my body because I have 0 appetite. I hardly drink and I cannot sleep. I'm being tortured mentally every waking minute. I want it to all end.
