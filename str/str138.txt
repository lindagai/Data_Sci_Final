You're pretty much describing my life. 95% of the time I am miserable. The few hours here and there when I manage to wrestle some small, fleeting happiness from life does not even begin to make any of this feel worth it.3 years of therapy and 15 different antidepressants under my belt with no meaningful change in my ability to cope with life's demands. Like you I confidently aimed for \"contentedness\" and eventually realized that all I was doing was maintaining a slightly better than suicidal mood (most of the time, anyway).I've begun contemplating major life changes. Doing some more drugs. Blowing what little cash I have and just setting out on the road, or hopping a train like a hobo. If it seems like I'm heading down the road towards suicide anyway why not have some experiences first?Tldr: Fuck Everything.
