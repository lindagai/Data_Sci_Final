Yesterday i've found some "evidence." that my girlfriend cheated on me multiple times with several man and incluiding had sex with one of em'. At the moment i almost fainted but i was able to hold on and go back home (i was at a class when my friends said that i started sweating like crazy and going pale. My vision was going blur :( )I cried non stopping for hours because i really loved her.Despite that i'm able to work again i don't know what i would do if i foubd out that thia is true.
