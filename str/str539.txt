Anytime a new friend/someone I haven't hung out with before wants to get together, I always make up an excuse or just flatout don't answer their texts.They probably think I'm being rude or that I don't want to hang out with them or that I don't like them. I know for a fact that a few people think that, because it's gotten back to me that people dislike me because I avoid them.I just wish I could tell them that it's my depression and cripplingly low self esteem. That I'm scared that we won't have anything to talk about, that I'll be boring, or that they'll realize I'm lame.\"It's not you, it's me\" is such a played out excuse, but in my case, it's true. It really is me. And I've missed out on so many opportunities and friendships because of it. Yet, I can't seem to break away from it. I'm in a new city after college, and I really should be saying yes to every opportunity, every new friend, every nerve-inducing hang/party. But I don't. I can't.
