I have severe Depression and Anxiety (OCD). I feel like I am constantly being told that being Suicidal is weak and I should just man up because they have had their own problems and they overcame them that I should be able to do the same. I hate it. I feel like nobody takes me seriously. Why is it so difficult for people to understand?
