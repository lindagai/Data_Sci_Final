So I'll start by saying I have reoccurring existential depression (self diagnosed). I find it extremely challenging to live in a world knowing that I'll die eventually.Even if we leave a legacy, those who will benefit from it will die and so on and so forth. The earth will die when our star dies, and the universe will likely end billions of years later.Even when I think about religion, why would I wanna live forever in life after death? To be constantly happy in "heaven" you wouldn't be yourself because you wouldn't be experiencing the same day-to-day emotions that we do now. We wouldn't be human without these. (This is my theory)Coming home to a judgemental family (oversimplified), and going to work with jaded co workers that bitch over the smallest thing infuriates me. So many pointless arguments, so many snide comments from both sides towards the other, it's pathetic.The issue is that I am very happy when with friends and I am a kind generous person with a large social influence around my friends and family. If I decide to off myself, I wouldn't even know how to explain what I feel. Sometimes I think f*** it, f*** them, but thinking about them grieving and suffering destroys me.TL;DR: I'm at a loss of what to do and I know what I do didn't matter anyways, because we will all die in the end anyways.
