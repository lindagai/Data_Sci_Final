Sometimes, it feels almost like a kind of plague. It's an ominous family heirloom, passed down between generations. But you don't talk about it. You just hand it over to the next in line. Growing up, I thought it was normal to rarely see anyone smile inside my house. I grew up knowing that I smiled too broadly, that I laughed too much, that my voice was too loud. I could take singing classes, but singing just because I felt like it was abnormal. It was not right to do something out of sheer pleasure. At school, people thought I was weird, so I'd be avoided. At home, they could not avoid me, so I'd be scolded. I thought seeing my mother cry while ironing the clothes was normal. I would cry most days, too. It's not like there ever was any kind of abuse. I know it wasn't their fault - they were raised the same way, and they knew when we weren't trying hard enough. So they were doing the best they could. I remember the last thing my little sister said when they dropped me off as I moved to another city for college. "You have abandoned me". I think about it almost every day. We both went to college. We both spent our college years being depressed, but highly functioning nonetheless. She is 25 now. She has an eating disorder. She has just been promoted, and although she's starving herself to death, she is praised as the reasonable one. She goes to work. She hates her life and is thoroughly miserable, but that's just the way things are, right? I am 27. I've been making my way through psychiatrists for eight years now. I have a job now, too. I kind of like it, but I should not say that. It's not fair to anyone else to say that I enjoy my job. They say I'm bipolar. That I feel things in an exaggerated manner. Sometimes, I do smile. I do laugh. But don't tell them about it.
