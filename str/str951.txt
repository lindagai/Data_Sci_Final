I'm at my lowest.I don't feel like i have any control over my life or surroundings. My earning potential is laughable. I've been single close to a decade and can't get a date, or even a response in most cases. I feel worthless. My housing situation is getting worse, and i can't afford to move. I don't even have a permanent job, can't get one.All i really have is a PC and a motorbike. No savings, can't afford to save on a minimum wage job with no job security.I feel like i've run out of options, run out of motivation to even try any more. I've become very bitter and angry. Even more anti-social than i ever was, and it's only getting worse. I don't know if i can keep going. I don't think it's worth it at all.Maybe i won't come back from a road trip i have planned. After all, motorbike accidents happen all the time. I don't think i'm really suicidal, but i'm getting less sure of that as time passes.I don't need help, i just need a chance. I don't want to talk to someone about my feelings. That's for me to figure out myself and i think shrinks are a joke. Maybe they work for others, but i refuse. I'm not going to talk to someone about my stupid problems. I don't even talk to my friends about them. They don't really care, but pay attention to look like a good friend. Fuck that. A shrink listens because they're paid to sit and look at some sad bastard who has failed to make something of themselves in life. People tell me that it's all going to be OK, that everything will work itself out. No, it's not going to be OK. They get to walk away feeling like they've tried to help, that saying 'cheer up' has any fucking effect. That they're at least better off than me with my sad little life.
