But it's not the same, right? When I keep from judging other people, it doesn't affect me if they don't believe what I say. But if I try to avoid judging myself, if the person being told (me) doesn't believe it, then it brings me down.I don't judge people because it makes them feel good when other people are nice to them. That doesn't apply to myself. Being nice to myself isn't a good feeling; it just feels like lying to myself.Is there a chance that anyone reading this gets what I'm saying?
