I can't explain how pissed off I am. Each day sucks balls, I think of the next day and I get suicidal and wonder how I will make it. This year I am being homeschooled and each day I have educational work with the exception of Sunday, which is boring and stuffed-down-my-throat. I like men and women, but as a bi I have to kinda shut up. I am insecure and very socially anxious and I get strong urges to cut, but I don't want lifelong scars, what do I do. So much pressure and pain and it's too much.My parents ignore my feelings, which make me wanna die even more to release the pain and let them know I was not and never was joking. I was a stupid ass teen a few months ago thinking depression was cool, and now I regret that BADLYYY. Can somone respond? I wanna die so badly, and I am starting to care less and less about family or future life when I will be free to do what I want and to not be dictated and feel like I am in a fucking jail voiceless. It's to overwhelming, it's too much. I close my door sometimes in my room and sit down on my bed and frown, or cry. I bashed my head through on the fucking bed just to cry, because it's hard to do it nowadays compared to before.I shrug when my sis asks if I am okay, and I feel dreadful as FUCK. I'm to young, I can't handle this. And the words cannot explain how it feels to wake up everyday with no one to look forward to, let alone get through. And I could end it with a bottle of bleach when everyone is out of sight, or worse, simple as that.
