I just don't. In school everyone hates me and insults me, I get beaten almost everyday, my mom started to drink, and maybe taking drugs aswell, who knows... My parents divorced long time ago, now I live with grandmother. I try to change something in my fucking life, but I can't. I always try to hide my pain, but something it gets really bad. Today I tried to kill myself, but what stopped me was, a girl that I had crush on about 2 weeks now, I tried to start a relation ship with her, we chatted with each other, but now I see, that she doesn't care about me, she became my light in this world, I feel like I can't live without her. Only thing I think about right now, is how to kill myself without any pain...
