Maybe remind yourself you didn't know better then. Maybe your emotions had better control. Maybe you were too young and hadn't developed the part of your brain that gives you empathy. Maybe you should accept that your remorse is a sign you've suffered enough. Whatever you did, it sounds like its haunted you enough. Maybe time to let the damn thing go and accept you've changed and have suffered enough. By that, I mean accept what's done is done. You regret it. You learned from it. People don't hate you for it so neither should you. Who knows? Maybe you have OCD and have a heightened sense of right and wrong. If that's the case then its DEFINITELY time to forgive yourself.
