I think motivating them to get up and accomplish things is key. Depression a brain wiring issue, so gently but strongly forcing them to get up and moving helps a ton.The up side to this, is that trying to stay motivated for them will also get you up, moving and active. If they are lying in bed, depressed and thinking that their life sucks it only makes things work. If you can help your partner, find things to do and accomplish (walk the dog, clean the house, make a dress, finish a table, anything) it will allow them to \"rebuild\" their brain to seek those activities more for joy. I read a post a while back of a woman with a military husband, who was very assertive and forceful to get her out and exercising. In this story, she was very happy and thankful to her husband. However I would be cautious in suggest the same would work for every relationship. I would want my wife to keep me moving.
