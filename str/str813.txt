I just don't know what to do. It's like I can't jusst get people to be interested in me in any way, everyone forgets me, I always go unnoticed. I went through college and made no friends. Sometimes I hang out with people I know back from highschool, but it's as if they never really want to listen to me, they just want to talk, and talk, and talk, and drink, and talk ... and when I try to open up about how I'm feeling or what's going on in my life no one wants to listen. I'm honestly tired of all that people, we have grow older and become different so I can't say I relate to them anymore... But sometimes I just need someone to hang around instead of having another pathetic night all alone in my room, like very weekend is: 48 hrs without talking to another human being. I would like to meet people and make new friends, but I just wouldn't know how to make people interested in becoming my friend. I have nothing positive to offer. I only have my pain and my loneliness. What can I do ??? I don't ask for great  friendship, or passionate everlasting love; That's way beyond what I can even imagine desiring.  I just  want to feel like someone cares for me. Not even my family cares for me. Sometimes I feel like I could die and no one would notice. This is just too much for me, I can't take it. Years and years without any joy in life, without no one to share what I live. What' the point of living if you can't share you what you experience? Tomorrow another weekend without any plans starts. Another weekend where I'll be just between the four walls of my bedroom, and probably I won't even shower, I won't even cook and end up eating poorly, I won't get out of bed because what's the point. And no one will care. No one will notice. No one will reach for me ...
