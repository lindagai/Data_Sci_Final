My sisters have only have one brother which is me and they expect me to be successful and achieve high and Im a disappointment, I don't know what to do, Im very stressed about my life and how I'm going to make my mum proud and its too hard I can't,  I pray everyday wondering when that day will come when I can achieve great and say mum I DID IT but I just want to die and end this stress, I feel this is the end.........
