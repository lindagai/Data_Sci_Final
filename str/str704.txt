I had an assessment today requested by my GP. Apparently I'm not mentally ill. I'm just not applying myself. The answer to being suicidal is to find something that gives me 'purpose'. Despite not being able to find the energy or desire to do anything. To stop cutting I just need to stop. Simple. My hallucinations are a product of my imagination. Oh, I might be autistic. Fuck off you cunt.
