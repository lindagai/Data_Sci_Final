i have all ways been the shy type. i have never had a friend longer then 2 years and have had trouble my whole life making friends. through highschool i was constantly bullied and had hardly any friends, and the ones i did have all ways found it hard hanging out with me outside of school because my father was very strict and most gave up on me very early. im 22 years of age now and the only people i would see often ( who has time for me or wants to see me) is my sister and my mother. the last three years have been the hardest for me, moving out of hime to live with partner, falling into the drug path, loosing my job and being diagnosed with depression and anxiety. i have all ways been told i have the softest heart and such a warm lovable person yet i feel that is my weakness and is why people use me the way they have. im trying so hard to pick myself back up and to get myself out and make friends but i dont know where to begin. how to even make friends, i feel that i will forever sit at home in my room just watching life fade away.
