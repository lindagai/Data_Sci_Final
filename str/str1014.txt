My depression is hitting me hard. I need a friend but I don't know who to turn to.I've been looking for a job, just something in retail, something to pay the bills. But I never hear back from anyone and it's getting frustrating. I'm scared for next month because I don't have much money and I have no idea how I'll pay bills.I've been trying to sell stuff off (things I've made in my Etsy store and things I already own) but no matter how much I advertise on social media, nothing. My friends say they'll buy stuff, and then nothing comes of it.When I need a friend, no one is there for me. I go out of my way to do things for people but no one thinks of me. I just....don't want to give a shit about anyone anymore. It makes me so jealous and so envious when I see another friend post about their relationship with one of their friends and I want that. I'm to the point where I want to kill myself. I don't care anymore. No one will miss me. No one will notice me gone. I'm not an integral part of anyone's friendship or anything like that so it's not like anyone will care. I already took some sleeping pills to help me sleep tonight, so it wouldn't be too difficult to take some more.
