When I used to get high to cope, I would rapidly shift into an entirely different mindset.  When high, I would be able to see past events in a positive light, remember good things that I had done or had happened to me, feel confident in myself, and feel hopeful about the future.  I would blaze and my thoughts would go from \"I'm a failure and a waste of space\" to \" I can forgive myself for all my mistakes, let go of my regrets, and move forward with a positive attitude.\"  And this shift would happen in a matter of minutes.   Gradually though, all those anxieties and depressive thoughts would seep back in as I came down, and that bright and hopeful mindset would slowly slip through my fingers over the course of the next couple hours.  I would watch it happen, as the negative thoughts that the high had quelled to the point of making them seem absurd became more frequent, more intense, until they dropped me off right where I started : depressed, anxious, alone, and wanting to get high again.Half the reason I stopped is because I want to believe that it's possible to achieve that positive and hopeful mindset without weed, and want to believe that I can sustain the ability to view my past and future life a positive light.  The other half is I recognized I was addicted, weed was the only thing that got me out of bed in the morning.
