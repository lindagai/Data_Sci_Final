I want to die, I have had thoughts of suicide for almost a decade but only realized that I AM going to do it recently. nobody knows how i feel and i refuse to burden them with that knowledge. I've given up on finding a solution to my suffering and find solace knowing it's coming to an end, but how do I explain it to my close family? I have hidden my depression for almost a decade and I don't want them to feel they should have noticed something or they weren't there for me, because they were I just couldn't tell them..
