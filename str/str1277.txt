I don't think life is shitty, but my perception of it certainly is. There are parts of that I can change and parts that I can't.For me, accepting that I will kill myself made it a hell of a lot easier to postpone that very action. The biggest problem with suicide isn't the actual suicide itself, but the uncertainty. There's such a huge internal conflict involved. The will to live, the pain that others will feel due to my actions if I continue living or if I die, the desire to stop feeling the way I feel, blah blah blah.It's exhausting. Just thinking about going another month/week/five minutes without suicide is really fucking difficult. Accepting that it's going to happen removed all that conflict, all the doubt and guilt.Suddenly, making it through the month is quite easy. I don't hate myself for wanting to die, I accept it. I still feel pain and cause pain for others, but I don't feel so shitty about it now. Everybody hurts and gets hurt. It usually isn't intentional.Now, I live by a principle of reduced harm. Not everything I do is super healthy. I get high now and then. I sometimes do stupid, reckless things because those things make me feel alive. But as long as I'm not actively hurting anyone, it doesn't have to be healthy. It's health*ier* than suicide.I do not have to be perfect. Over time, my ability to function in society will deteriorate and I'll end up either as a homeless addict or permanently institutionalized. Eventually, I will die. Now that I know and accept these things, I can move on to more pressing matters. What am I going to do in the mean time?
