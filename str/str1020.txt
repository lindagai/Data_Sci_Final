I would like to start this by saying i would to remain anonymous and just share something deep and personal. I'm not looking for a pity party i just felt like sharing what I'm currently feeling because no one i know would even get a bit of what I'm truly feeling but i hope you all can at least see where i'm coming fromI'm fucking horribleI absolutely hate myself I'm nothingUselessWorthlessA waste of timeA burden on all my friends and family and my loved oneI should just end it somedayI can't even do anything right and i fuck up everything and every relationshipI have no fucking good qualitiesI can't fix anythingI can't cleanI can't cookI'm not athleticI'm uglyI'm not a good studentI'm clumsyNot trustworthy apparentlyI'm probably shit at music its just everyone is too nice to tell me anything because they think i'm going to be hurtI'm seriously contemplating leaving everyone's life so it can be the one thing i did right in all my fucking useless lifeKnow when to leave before i just ruin everyone's life I'm ungrateful of what i haveMy parent's have always given me everything i ever wanted ever since i was a child yet I'm still fucking depressed because none of them even take the time to truly listen to me but they deserve a better son, I'm just a disappointment. I have not once ever made them truly proud of me.Not even my girlfriend fucking believes in me anymoreShe may say she has faith in me or whatever but I'm not stupidShe doesn't believe in me anymore and thinks my word isn't worth shit and I'm not even fucking worth her time like why the hell am i even with her if i'm always fucking insecure and feel like shes going to cheat? I'm literal fucking trash and i don't deserve to even be with anyone I'm probably meant to be alone because I'm too goddamn emotionally unstable and i have very low self esteem and how the saying goes "you have to love yourself before you can love anyone" but i can't even fucking do thatI probably won't live passed 40 from my constant tormentI have a vice that really isn't healthy for me but i continue to so i can at least ignore myself and drown out my insecurities but it always comes backEveryone should stop giving a shit about me because i'm not worth redeemingI'm so sorry to everyone for being a burdenSorry to my friends for ever having crossed paths with them and torment them with my bullshit Sorry to my parents for not being a good son and just a overall disappointment to my whole familySorry to my brothers for being a burden to them and for annoying them and for having them put up with meSorry to my lover for not being the lover she deservesI'm sorry to everyone and I won't bother the world someday and when it happens. All my loved ones will have a much better life without meI'm sorry
