Just had a similar experience 5 minutes ago... well sort of. Was looking through some facebook photos for a nice backdrop on my new desktop computer. Haven't been on facebook in a while. I saw some pictures of the days when I was most depressed, my suicidal days. Lasted about 7 years. I'm better now but WOW have I changed. It hurt me to see those, knowing how I felt behind those smiles. I'd be in a picture with friends, happy, yet each and every second all I wanted to do was shove a knife into my neck. Just looking at how stupid and sad I was just flooded me with sadness and regret. I regret those days of being depressed because I feel like I wasted so much time and so many opportunities. I was not okay in the head at all but I appeared to be the happiest guy with all my act together. Looking at those photos made my sink a whole bunch, this hurts. I'm no longer suicidal and I can't even think of my last seriously 'depressed' episode. Whether I'm cured or not, I still get hit with regret from those deep, dark years. It lingers there and I don't know how to shake it off. Things get better, don't look at the past. That person in those selfies of yours may have been so sad underneath. Pictures don't always tell the truth. Since I ditched social media I have been so much happier. Trudge on, friend.
