Your friend is ignorant and cold-hearted. You are *not* stupid nor selfish for being suicidal. I would strongly recommend spending time with only those who wouldn't say that kind of stuff to you. But of course, it's hard to judge that on the outside. I made the mistake of confiding my suicidality with my brother's girlfriend (she was suicidal at one point too, so I trusted her), and she told me I should be thankful that I have it better than a lot of other people. So, that shit can really come from anyone. It's what makes me *incredibly* picky about who I talk to.
