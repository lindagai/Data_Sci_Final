I just took a ton of pharmaceuticals. Just waiting for them to kick in. In only a few minutes I should be dead. I can honestly say I don't regret it yet. Everything is numb, so it's really hard to type this. I don't need help anymore. I just wanted to have my final thoughts be somewhere. Anyway, goodbye.
