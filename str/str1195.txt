Well,I say it was a panic attack, but the main reasons behind a panic attack didn't really apply I don't think. I was sitting at work at my desk when I noticed that my heart was beating to a crawl which felt really discomforting.  All of a sudden I felt a huge gush of adrenaline go through my chest, all the way down and through my arms. My body went cold, numb and my heart was beating very irregularly. I genuinely thought I was suffering a heart attack, and the panic escalated at the thought of me collapsing and potentially dying. I remained seated for the next minute and nothing happened. I was still experiencing the heart palpations but I was convinced that I wasn't in any serious danger. All of this happened seemingly for no reason at all.  I don't consider myself to have any real social anxiety issues ; I get on quite well at work and with others around me.  I plan to contact my GP for reassurance and hopefully see if I can prevent it in the future because it scared the shit out of me.
