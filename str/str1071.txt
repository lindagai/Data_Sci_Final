If my cousins didn't love me so much, I'd be dead. But, in their words, (NAME)'s my favorite cousin. I've been told that by all my cousins, aged 4-11. I had no clue I'm likable. I wish I wasn't so likable. If I wasn't so likable no one would care if I died. People trust me with their secrets. Why do they? I'm one of 2 people who know my friend of 11 years is bi (he lives in homophobe city). I know my dad's struggle to make money. I know he uses a shitty translator to beef up the books and outsources his writing.TL;DR I want to be hated.
