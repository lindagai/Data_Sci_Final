Just a year ago, I was a happy person, who was carrying on with his life. And then I got sent abroad, to do my university course. It was the first time I would be living abroad, alone. I suffered too much stress, and this eventually caused sleep problems for around 4-5 months. Being a hypochondriac, I began stressing about and worrying about a deadly illness. This eventually gave way to racing thoughts while sleeping, which continue to this day. I basically have semi-lucid dreams which seem like hallucinations, and racings thoughts and voices during sleep, and during waking up and falling off to sleep. Besides this, I am having intense feelings of being detached from reality including surroundings and people, and phobias of normal things and sounds for no reason. This all started when I became worried about developing psychosis, and now I think I am actually developing it. I was already suffering from problems earlier- my mother is extremely ill, and her illness is stress caused. The stress of me having psychosis would kill her. My grandmother has Alzheimer's. I really dont know what to do. I cannot go on anti psychotics and become a medicated zombie. My only hope is that there might be some people here who had these symptoms and DID NOT develop psychosis, but that seems bleak. That's why I have decided that considering my circumstances, I will kill myself soon.
