I didn't attempt suicide nor even intend to... just wanted to make sure that was clear... I am suicidal but not actively trying... actively trying to avoid it.They have already prescribed me a benzo I think (I'm not sure) which didn't do anything for me so I stopped taking it. I did ask for a mood stabilizer but he insisted that would make me sleepy. Meanwhile I got like 3 hours of sleep again last night.
