I go back and forth on this everyday. Idk what to do. I don't think Id kill myself, but I want to be honest with him. He knows I feel worthless and he's trying to help and he is helpful so do I just outright say it? I just do not want anyone else to know. i know thats unreasonable but I don't want my family finding out ever. What do I do???
