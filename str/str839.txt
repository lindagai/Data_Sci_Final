I am 18, and dropped out of middle school, and have only had a single job, which I quit only after 3 months last week.    I have decided. I'm not cut out for living a normal life.    The idea of college terrifies me and makes me feel numb and sad and empty. The prospect of a 9-5 job makes me fucking want to die even more. I don't want this. I don't want to live a fucking life where all I do is just wake up, go to work, come home, and then just watch tv. That's not what I want. But it's all I can see.    I'm not good at anything either. I don't have anything to make a career out of. I can program, sure, but I don't have the mindset or aptitude to truly operate in a work setting. I went on UpWork yesterday and the projects were so out of my league I wanted to cry.    I like writing, but I'm so in-confident in my abilities as a writer that I don't even want to bother trying. I think my prose is fucking hideous and ugly. And it is. And finding work as a writer is neigh impossible.    That's it. That's the only things I think I'd have a shot at enjoying in my life as work, but I just don't think I can pull it off.    I just don't think I belong in this world.    All I stay alive for is my mother. And it's suffering.
