I'm so burned out on my dead-end life. The last 4-5 months have been horrible. I see the faintest glimmers of hope that things could finally turn around for me, but nothing happens and with each new problem my hopes drop a little more. I can't take it anymore. It's truly becoming all I can do to keep up pretenses when I'm around people. When I'm alone I drink and cry and pray that I'll black out and won't wake up. I hate myself and I'm not sure how much longer I can endure. The last time I felt truly hopeful was 10 years ago. Maybe 11.I'm sure I've wished for death a thousand times, but it never comes. I still find myself praying for release from existence, even though I'm more agnostic than anything else - I know that whatever supreme entity exists beyond this world doesn't give a rats *** about me. Not that anyone should, since I seem to ruin everything. If any of you believe in anything beyond this life, please, please, please pray for death to finally take me. I don't want to commit suicide, because I don't want to hurt anyone, but I seriously don't feel like I can go on much longer. I can't fake it anymore. I can't keep trying when I know that nothing will ever change for the better, and anything that seems to is just a sad joke and always turns bad anyway.Thanks for reading. I know this is a bit of a mess, but I don't care. I'm just exhausted. It's just too much to take. I am being totally serious about the prayers for death. Doubt it'll work, but if it does it'll be easier for those who know me to bear than my suicide.
