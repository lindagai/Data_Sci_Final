This is happening right now:When I am very angry at my gf I want to hurt her. But not immediately. When she gets me angry i try to solve the problem with reason, logic and a solution to the problem. She often refuses to accept or even listen to my proposals. I like the idea of using your words to solve problems and talking it out. Its not even when she rejects all reason that i want to hurt her. At this point i just tell her to leave me alone because we arent solving this problem anytime soon. Its when she rejects all reason the proceeds to PURPOSELY irritate me as a response:Following me aroundTalking to me like nothings wrongBeing faux-nice(like asking me if i want something she knows i don't like)asking why im ignoring hermessing with me while im trying to relax or sleepusing a cutesie voice like everything is perfectasking me why im so madsinging EXTRA LOUDtelling me that i shouldn't be madand whole bunch of other shit..Its when she does this that i want to hurt her. And i truly believe she deserves it. But you can't put your hands on a female so i can't do anything. At this point I need to detonate. So i can either just give myself time to calm down but know this will happen again and again and again. Or I can kill myself and never have anymore problems ever again.
