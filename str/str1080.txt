I go to a psychiatrist and tell her, but she doesn't really seem to care or try to do anything. I am thinking about asking her for some new meds, some different kid than I have taken so far. I have a therapist appointment later this month. Getting committed is too much, 30 days would likely drive me to suicide, I need sleep, I need my computer.
