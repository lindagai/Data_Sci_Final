I'm on medicine and started seeing a therapist. I can't stop crying and mourning failed relationships that don't matter. I'm fixating on these tiny trivial things. I feel so ungrateful and ashamed. I feel like the only way to end these depressing thoughts is if I die. I plan out new ways I could kill myself. Last night I even wrote a suicide letter. I ended up just crying a seeing a friend. I don't know what to do anymore. I wonder if I will always feel so insignificant and meaningless. My current ex boyfriend told me none of my exs loved me and one would even piss on my grave. I'm starting to believe that this is true, that I'm here for nothing and have no value anymore.
