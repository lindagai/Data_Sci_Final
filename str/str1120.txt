Honestly I think I'm just a shitty person. No matter what I do I'm gonna end up unhappy and unfulfilled and narcissistic and controlling and needy. I mean, there have to be shitty people in the world, right? Someone's gotta do it. It seems like it is my genetic lot in life and I'll never be capable of a real relationship or real happiness, and never really know what it is. I feel hopeless right now, and I'm alone.
