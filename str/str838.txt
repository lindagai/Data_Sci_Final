I am disappointed of who I am  sometimes . I am 25 no job . I study a lot  my aunts constantly saying to me your age I had worked many jobs . she seems to think I should be like her  and that pisses me . in honestly times I want to kill my self so I don't have to listern to expectations of others . I am not smart like  them I am not  brainy . I  am just me . logical kind hearted kaytie . I am tired of being treated like a kid . I am tired of being left out I have Asperger's. don't mean you  have to fucking stick the label to me and treat me like a kid . times I  want to run away  and jump off a cliff maybe they would care maybe they would but I'm just so tired  of people treating me like shit ... I'm tired of people trying to apply olden day shit to my life . its my fucking life!!!!!!!!!! I feel trapped in  a endless maze . I am at the point I want to slit my wrists  . if you didn't guess I  don't have the money to run away I don't have money to have my own life . I am tired being treated like a kid urrrrrrgggggggggggggh sorry I m just so fucking mad and I just cant calm down
