I feel lost, alone, and hopeless. I'm mostly bipolar, but still depression is of course a part of that. My serious gf who I planned to marry and was about to move cross country with next month left me a few weeks ago. I've been obsessing over how to get her back for these last 3 weeks and recently found out she hopped on a rebound guy almost immediatly after we broke up. She is coming to pick up the rest of her shit in a few hours. I'm so torn. Between anger, anxiety, and despair. I love her so much and knowing this is probably the last time we will see each other outside of work is killing me. I keep thinking about all the good things we had and I just want to die. I feel betrayed and used. I still love her and know she is just blowing off steam because as she told a coworker, "I am dying and hating myself." But even that hurts to see her self destructing into drugs, missing work, and rebounding off a random guy she met. I can't stop drinking, though I'm trying I'm an alcoholic. I have no education beyond high school. No skills except restaurant work. I had to move back to my mom's place in 2014 and now am stuck here longer. I'm 25 and feel like a failure. Feels like I have no future and the only to get out is drinking myself to death.
