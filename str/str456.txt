I sorta sassed my ass off in school until I got suspended for a week and they realized I had problems, so then I was put on homebound and I'm on medication now. Plus I got a month of sitting at home being a lazy-ass teenager :D That won't work for you because you're in university, but if you do get kicked out then it's better to just tell them.
