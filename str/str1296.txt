Dude are you me? You just discribed my life, i allready failed 1 year  of school, so i had to repeat it again só i could probably fail  once more, i feel exactly like you, and i Also play video games to pass the time, i'm in an abusive relationship, wich doesn't help, if i fail this year im going to change school and go back to the 10°th grade again because i want to go to another school, and believe me, its hard, i don't want to kill myself, i have to much pride, but if i were to die it would be fine, my best and only friend is leaving to germany, and i left my girfriend because she abused me in every way possible, now i must go back to the 10°th grade again, me an 18 year old that is in the wrong school, with the wrong people, i feel you, i know what that is, but the way out of depression is that you must truly believe in yourself , not kidding, i allways say to myself "i'll sort things out" and go on with life, unnafraid, it could be worse, you have to force yourself to do the things you love and find a reason in life, i have no one, i will Start again, and this time ill do it, you should do the same, i feel you, im here, you are not the only one. Sorry for the long post.
