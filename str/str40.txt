firstly. I'm sorry. secondly, I raged for years over my lack of social skills/friends - that is until I got them. friends can provide validation and boost self-worth but they can also trivialize, misinterpret or simply not give a shit about you and your problems. happiness may need to develop independent of your social. idk. good luck
