I'm sorry to hear this.  Terminal cancer is a bitch to face. I've lost about 7 people to cancer now. a couple friends, a couple of inlaws.  I'm usually pretty stoic about it. This is the second one i was really close to.  I havent found many people who had the kind of long term positive friendship that I just lost.  I've had one friend beat it. I hope you are able to work with your Cancer specialists and see if you can help further the study so some day we can cure this damn thing. Hold your loved ones close. they will miss you.
