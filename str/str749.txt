I have ruined my life looking for affection. I have taken decisions exclusively to attempt to find a loving person. This starvation ruined my social life, my education, my development as a person. I have not been looking for a woman, although. I've often skipped basic adolescent milestones to find a person to replace with my father. The first I met was a pedophile, the second a drug dealer. Both teached me more about life than my father has. The strong desire to have a loving female partner made me abuse my autistic skills such as my overdeveloped manipulative and lying skills. I attempted to make girls fall in love with me with methods that are not appropriate.  I have switched over from an IT course to a Language one after failing the year because I hoped I would've found a lover. This hasn't happened and my education has gone wrong. I failed the year again. Now I am in a situation where I can't find people to even socialise without friendships being tied to weed or drug dealing. I have lost 23 kilograms in 2015 because I would often use my money for weed, rather than for food.Do I just kill myself at this point?
