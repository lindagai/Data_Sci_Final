There are a lot of other options out there that may show people how miserable you are without resorting to anything too extreme. Have you spoken to a professional about how you're feeling? They may be able to explain it in words your loved ones can understand.One other option I've heard of is committing yourself to a hospital. They'll definitely take you seriously there, whether anyone else does or not. I can't guarantee your family/friends will see it as a show or misery or just an attempt for attention, though if it's the latter you might want to distance yourself from them. If they really won't take you seriously after something major like that, they're plain toxic.Hope things work out for you, OP.
