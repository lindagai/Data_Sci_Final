Right now I'm having a mini panic attack, and I can't stand it. Sometimes I'll growl. Sometimes I just die a thousand times in a single moment. My soul is being devoured, becoming sustenance for my apathy. I want a girlfriend but I can't survive long enough. I want to die. But not really. But maybe. Probably not. Would you please kill me?
