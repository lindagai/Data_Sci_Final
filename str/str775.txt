My 20th birthday is coming up and all I want to do is die. I've hated my life ever since I was born. I've always been treated like a lesser human being. Even when I'm in a group of people,  sooner or later I will be ousted and hated  upon and looked down upon. I have liked no aspect of my life so far from childhood to where I'm at now. Definitely not now because I have no where else to go. If it wasn't for my parents I would OD tonight on pills in my dorm while I'm bout to fail my online physics class because I don't understand any of it and I feel dumb. Also I'm playing football at a community college or JUCO because the coaches said I wasn't good enough and they're probably right because I'm not that athletic and even all that strong. Plus I have expectations to go pro or something even though I don't care to because of my multiple major injuries that I had so far. Everyday I go to bed hoping that I never wake back up. I seriously just want to die right now. I don't have the courage to commit suicide right now but maybe one day I'll just snap I don't know. I don't even know. I just want to end it all tonight so I can finally be happy. I feel like I won't be truly happy till I am dead and in the dirt. At that point I'm finally at peace and all my worries are over. Some say it's a cowards way out so maybe I'm a coward. Am i? Sometimes I just want to drink till I can barely remember anything so I can have a brief moment of faded happiness in my life before it all goes back to crap. If I had a gun right now I have to out it to my head to decide right now. I'm not trolling but I'm just saying what's going threw my mind right now as I'm having an episode...it's all too much for me. I still have two labs and 2 quizzes due Thursday and a midterm to study for that I don't even understand and I'm supposed to get an A. Yeah right lol. Hopefully one day when I breath my last breath. I can finally put a smile on my face.
