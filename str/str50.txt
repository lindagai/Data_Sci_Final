To be quite honest, as it stands right now there really isn't a point of beeing positive, you've been cheated on, that can break the best of us. Also not beeing invited to job interviews after sending out a lot of applications feels bad, makes you feel worthless, i got used to it... Since i don't know you, i don't know what kind of person you are, but never forgive her, cheaters are cheaters and they'll not change, don't blame yourself for the cheating either, it's one of the most horrible things one person can do to another.
