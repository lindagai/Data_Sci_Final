I need  to get on antidepressants. I've tried fighting this on my own for a year. Therapy hasn't worked, and diet and exercise keep it at bay, but I just want to feel like myself again. It's been so long and I'm tired. Anyway, I'm a university student and I went to the clinic. First I had to pay $120 to see the doctor (because it's summer i guess). Then the doctor told me he wasn't allowed to prescribe antidepressants and I would have to see the university psychiatrist ($120 wasted). To see the psychiatrist I'll need to pay $200 per visit. I have only $80 in my bank account right now. I'm working 2 jobs but it's really hard to make ends meet. They were able to give me a referral to only one psychiatrist in the whole city that takes my health insurance and they conveniently aren't accepting any new patients.Why is it so hard to get better? I thought the hard part was deciding that I needed help, and being proactive about it. I guess the even harder part is finding someone that can fucking help me. I know I'm being childish and impatient, but it shouldn't be this difficult or this expensive or have so many hoops I need to jump through. Why wont the university allow their doctors to prescribe antidepressants? Why won't my $120 fee cover a psychiatrist visit? Why is the only psychiatrist who takes my insurance not accepting more patients? Why wont anyone else take my insurance? Why is my university so terrible at helping people? I'm ready to give up. I don't have time and energy for this because I work all day. I had to take off from work today to chase this pointless endeavor and I can't do it again anytime soon. Sorry for the rant. I just feel so hopeless.
