I've struggled with the same thing. I can't articulate myself well, become more quiet, and I can't focus on anything. For the past 6 years, I've steadily grown more insecure about my intelligence to the point where I just want to kill myself out of shame. I've been called an idiot many times because I have a habit of repeating myself in conversation. My boss and several of my coworkers called me a dumbass when they thought I couldn't hear them. A homeless woman I was helping called me an idiot under her breath.Like others have said, it's like living through a fog. I'm removed from my environment and can't spot things easily. Usually people have to point things out for me or I won't see them. Even the simplest concepts seem to elude me, and it takes awhile for things to sink in. I can't even spell correctly anymore and I can never remember anything. If I put something down, anything, I will forget it in 10 seconds. I'm constantly searching for something.Occasionally, there will be a break in the fog. The happiest I've been in the last 6 years was when I was reading Pride and Prejudice. Usually I can't focus or understand anything, but for whatever reason everything was coming to my fluidly and I was able to follow the dialogue and story without difficulty. I was so excited that I could finally read again. I thought maybe it was just this particular book, but when I came back to it the next day I was lost and had to put it down out of frustration. I'm always asking myself: Was I always this dim and just couldn't see it until depression set it? Will it ever get any better than this?Like a lot of kids, my parents told me I was smart and I kind of based my identity around that because I thought I had no other redeeming qualities. If I'm not smart, what good am I to anyone?
