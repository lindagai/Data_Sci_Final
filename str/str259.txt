Very happy for you, but unfortunately something like this doesn't give me hope. I hope and I'm sure it will for many others, and sorry to complain but I just thought I'd highlight it. I've never kissed anyone either, but I just don't care about it that much. I don't think it would change that much for me. Again, I'm happy for you though.
