Yes. Sometimes. It's especially difficult the older you get. Hope you work it out. I always recommend 5HTP. It is a natural vitamin that helps with depression, anxiety, and insomnia. A bottle that lasts a month is 20$. Maybe you could try it. It did wonders for me. I still get down, but it's not as awful as it was a year ago. Send me a PM anytime. We can chat if you need to
