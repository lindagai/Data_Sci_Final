This is going to be long so I'm sorry but someone please help me. I am so lost. I've been going through depression for the past 3 years and anxiety most of my life. For some reason my depression is worse when I'm single. I really noticed this when my first boyfriend of two years broke up with me and I lost control of myself. The I got a new boyfriend and everything felt okay again. I felt wanted and important. Then the other day he broke up with me. Said he just had a gut feeling we weren't meant to be. I loved him and he had told me he loved me but took it back when he broke up with me and told me he had lied. So yeah my heart is broken. And now I'm alone. Okay so after all that happened my dad asked what was wrong and I said I didn't want to talk about it( which I always do with him because I don't want a lecture) and so he decided to just start yelling at me. He said I need to stop going to the psychologist so much because I'm not even getting better and I need to just learn how to be more positive (depression isn't a choice and I don't think he gets that). He told me I'm bringing my whole family down. And I told him I go to the doctor so often in order to keep myself alive because things are rough and he said if I wanted to kill myself I would have done it already and I should just do it finally. He said he would be at peace with it because he has done everything to try to help me. So I got really really close to just doing it but I was too scared. But I'm starting to wonder if maybe he's right.. I'm never going to get better. I don't want to live like this. Everyday is such a struggle. Tldr: I get extra depressed when I am single and recently had a harsh break up. Dad told me to just kill myself because I'm always so unhappy. Considering just ending it but I'm scared.
