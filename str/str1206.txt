Even if someone talks to me, I feel like they're just being polite. I see other people talking to each other and they're connecting and genuinely enjoying each other's company, but my conversations are nothing like that. Today I saw this guy talking to this really attractive girl and he had a huge smile on his face the whole time. When I try to talk to guys they just seem mildly uncomfortable or bored, which makes me want to stop trying entirely because it's like I'm imposing on them.
