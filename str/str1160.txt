God our Father,    in good times    may I live in such a way    that I will be strengthened    for the difficult times    that all of us face in our lives.    Lead me now    to make positive choices    to value friendship and loyalty,    and develop attitudes and values,    treasuring all that is lasting and important.    Throughout difficult times    may I build on    the positive choices of my past,    looking outward in the service of others    and avoiding self-pity.    May I grow in the faith    that, whatever my circumstances,    I need have no regrets    but may entrust    my past to your mercy,    my present to your love,    and my future to your Providence.    Amen.
