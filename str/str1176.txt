My window of opportunity to do this is short and I'm pretty much timing it between one housemate leaving for work and another coming home (night shift) and I've got about 2-3 hours. Will sleeping pills like triazolam just knock me out and I'll die peacefully or will I be vomiting and violently shaking and stuff? I don't know how long it'll take so I'm worried I'll be found. I don't want to be a vegetable lol
