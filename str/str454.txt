I've been struggling with anxiety and depression for years but things became really bad within the past year, to the point where I felt like I had absolutely no purpose in life and would be better of just dead. I am young and have a great job that I love (on most days) but I just could not shake the terrible depression and anxiety.I love dogs (especially Golden Retrievers) so much, and they always brought me such joy growing up. I haven't had one for almost 10 years now and I miss that companionship so much. There's no question that having a dog would give me a greater sense of purpose in life and a reason to get up in the morning. However, the landlord I've been renting from for the past 5 years has a no dog policy. After discussing it in treatment, my psychiatrist wrote me a \"prescription\" for an Emotional Support Animal which means that my landlord would have to accommodate my illness and my need for a dog.I'm just nervous about it, though. I am afraid to talk to my landlord because 1. she might judge me because of my diagnosed mental health condition and 2. she might think I am just being a pain in the ass resident. Also, what will my neighbors think? I have a legitimate reason to have an ESA but reading about everyone who abuses the privilege is really disheartening. I don't plan to take the dog to fancy restaurants or to demand special treatment in public places because I have an ESA. I know they're not service dogs. I just want to be able to care for an animal in the apartment I have, which I love living in.Does anyone have any insights or experiences they could share with me?
