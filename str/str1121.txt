Second update post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/4ntxeg/its_time_to_kick_myself_into_gear_weekly_update_2/)First update post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/4mr52h/its_time_to_kick_myself_into_gear_weekly_update_1/)Starting post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/4lnpv3/its_time_to_kick_myself_into_gear/)Missed last week, and this week's post is late, because of a lot of things, but it boils down to the end of the school year (I teach), going on a week long camping trip, and preparing to move out of our current rental.**Last weeks goals were:**1. Get to bed 6 out of 7 nights between 9 and 9:30.2. Get at least 1/2 hour of exercise every day.3. Mindfulness meditation for 30 minutes 6 out of 7 days, and 5 to 10 minutes right before bed each night.4. Limit all internet activity to 2 hours per day. **What went well this week:** I think we met pretty much all of the goals, except for the bed time one- stayed up pretty late some nights. Oh, and meditation. That didn't happen. Had a very relaxing camping trip and 2 interviews for next year, hopefully I'll hear back today. **What didn't go so well**Did not meditate hardly at all- I' going to scale back this goal and try to ramp up to half an hour over a month or two. **My plan for making it work better next time**Meditation is the big one right now, partially because it's summer time, and we haven't decided what time we should be going to bed and waking up now that school is out. Right now the goal is to meditate for 2 minutes a day, building up to 5 minutes at the end of the week (baby steps!).**Tasks for the week**This is a pretty big week- I'll hear back from two interviews, and we are out of our rental by Thursday, though because we're living with friends we could theoretically take more time. Currently, the plan is to store most of our stuff in a friend's attic, and camp in another's back yard for a coup weeks until we know where we're living. Tasks include packing (which would include sorting through things and deciding yet again what to keep and what to re-home... we are aspiring minimalists.), finding a new place to live, and locking in a contract for next week.**Goals for Next week:**1. Get at least 1/2 hour of exercise every day- including a first thing in the morning walk with Fuzzytoes.2. Mindfulness meditation for between 2 and 5 minutes 6 out of 7 days.3. Limit all internet activity to 2 hours per day.
