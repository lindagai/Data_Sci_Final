It did exhaust me yeah. I told my parents i couldn't sleep at night to explain the fact that i sept like 3 hours during the day every day. Told them it was insomnia. And it was a bit true cause it kept me up at night thinking about how i'm doing everything to ruin my life and that i should just kill myself in a few years. That's the depression thinking though, i know how wrong it is and i don't look forward to death or anything. Actually sometimes i'm scared that i'll commit suicide when not thinking clearly. Sometimes when i think about the future it ends with "if i'm still alive though". But i'm happy currently and it feels good, almost weird like it's weird not spending so much time thinking about how pathetic i am and just do stuff i enjoy. I hope that this will happen to you soon or when you need it most.
