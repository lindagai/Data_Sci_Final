Distraction and daydreaming is literally my life right now. I'm so depressed that it's ruined my physical heath and I'm afraid to even leave my home anymore. I distract myself with some hobbies and interests i have left. But eventually, the times come when you can't escape anymore... I'm 20 years old male, got out of high school 2 years ago, and mom given up on me, so I guess I have to find the courage to kill myself soon enough, for everyone's sake. But how??? I failed once and I won't do it again unless I can be sure I'll be dead. Anyone know how?
