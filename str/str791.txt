I've tried it all. I tried to medicate away the first part of my life and that didn't help. I've gone as far as tripping on LSD and mushrooms, having my life changed for the better, for months, for years. It always comes back. A few months ago I started working out, meditating daily, trying to do my life the "right" way, the way that my parents who screamed at me daily throughout childhood told me to. It worked for a while. Gave me structure. Now its back. It feels like there's no escape, no matter how I live my life or how hard I try it just creeps up on me and fucks me. Seriously. Tell me. Why shouldn't I kill myself? What gives you, someone who has no fucking clue what goes through my head every day, the right to tell me that "lol it gets better"? No one even wants to be around me. The people who once called me their friend won't invite me to hang out or even answer my texts at this point. Why is it that I have to live in this small town where everyone knows my entire history? Why is it that if I left then I would just fuck things up wherever I went anyways? Tell me why I shouldn't just end this pile of horseshit life
