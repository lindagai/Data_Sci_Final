Hey not sure where else to post it (fuck i'm making a post on the internet about feeling bad rock meet bottom)So i just realize i have not spoken to anybody (excluding co-workers how well speaking to is mandatory) for about a month now.I think i can come to the conclusion that there is literally nobody in the world that gives enough of a fuck to check if i'm not dead yet.So i could just go away again ( as i have done before with friend groups ) and end up never speaking to any of them again make new friends and repeat this cycle but i feel like the reason i end up isolated is because of me at some point the problem has to be mine, why do i end up meeting people who are nice and all but really don't care the moment i remotely leave there field of vision.
