I think you and I may have a lot in common. E.g. I've experienced about 8 or 9 years of maladaptive daydreaming and had a very \"conservative\" upbringing which was full of isolation and various identity issues... My quick piece of advice is to treat it similarly to other forms of addiction. Try to gradually reduce the time you allow yourself to daydream. This may sound too simplistic/idealistic, but I have a few strategies to help myself spend more time in \"reality.\" For me, socializing alleviates the fantasies the most and keeping busy with a consistent schedule is a close 2nd. A nice place to start may be to record how much time you spend fantasizing and then set realistic goals from there. Feel free to PM me by the way. I think chatting about our experiences with this could be mutually beneficial.
