I'm not going to even try to pretend to understand what that must be like. But I am going to say that you made the most rational choice. You didn't ignore the facts or the imminent danger to you and your children, and you took an action that many people would be too weak to take.Whatever you do, don't blame yourself for anything. It might be an ugly truth that's hard to see right now, but you made the right decision and did exactly what you had to do. And at the end of the day, that's what matters.Remember your children, but also remember that you deserved, and always will deserve, to continue living.
