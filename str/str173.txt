Yeah, I know the quote. In my case, I've done *nothing*. I've been a ghost through the best years of my life, I've done only destructive things, and I hate who I am. I can't recapture the feeling of being young, of innocence and excitement, my youthful good looks, etc &amp; so forth. But I appreciate the effort and sentiment.
