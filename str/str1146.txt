I live with a couple and one is depressed.  He has an open mind and it seems like he wants to do things to feel better, but I know some of the choices he makes (diet, lack of exercise, playing video games) are making it worse.  I know these choices make him feel better in the moment, but are negative in the long run.  My other roommate (who isn't depressed) and I are extremely positive and have a silver lining and yes outlook on life.  We try to gently nudge him in the right direction without making him feel a.) ganged up on and b.) mothered (which he hates). Does anyone have any tips on how to help someone with depression without pushing them away even further?  I appreciate any help that's given.  I myself am a recovering alcoholic, so I know what it feels like to hate being told what to do while knowing what is being suggested is the truth.  Thanks :)
