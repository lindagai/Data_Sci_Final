I don't even care about having a relationship.  I will do anything for sex other than a prostitute.  I have a nice job, and I can't get laid for crap.  I go to the gym but I'm depressed as shit.  There's all these girls having sex at my apartment, and all these beefy bro's near me that I know are having sex with 100's of women.  I get rejected by fat women, single moms, ugly women, ALL women.  I just want to get laid, that's it.  I even lost a really good job because I asked a girl out at work.  I don't fucking give a shit about ANYTHING in life other than sex right now, it's very easy for me to make money.. be "successful" but GETTING LAID is fucking impossible for me, I been rejected by over 500 women now, I am suicidal about it.This has been haunting me for the past 5 years, I been trying to do everything I can and I'm losing my willpower.  It's absolutely stupid that there's homeless people who get laid, people who are autistic..fat or anything and they all get laid.  I CAN'T GET LAID.  It's not about being lonely, I couldn't care about that.  I just care about having sex.I think about it every day, while I'm at workk.  while I'm hanging out with people.  I wouldn't mind giving up my career, half my lifespan and home just to have a sex life.
