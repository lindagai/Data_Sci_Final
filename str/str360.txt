I think what you're saying is true. It's my dad I'm talking about. I think he's mostly disappointed in me now that he doesn't know I'm depressed (doing badly in college, not doing anything with my days now that it's summer, being easily annoyed and not willing to talk about stuff). I actually don't know why I'm not telling him. I just can't.
