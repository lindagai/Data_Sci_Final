Yeah everyday. Videogames aren't even fun anymore. Feels more like work or a chore.I can see patterns so easily. Games become repetitive or mundane.Wish there was a way to check out peacefully like at the vet office. No real reason to be here anymore I don't see the grand scheme. Why am I slavingaeau for ??
