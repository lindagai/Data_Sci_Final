Same. When I feel low I end up just telling myself "I want to die" but I don't want to be dead, it's just a way of feeling like I won't have to deal with anything. I don't know if you feel similarly but I can only assume. I just remind myself that while I feel this way I am not going to kill myself, that that isn't what I actually want.
