I am a senior is college. I have been taking 18 credits a semester since I started right after high school. I am going for my masters next year. I'm already $100k in debt. I'm getting my degree in education because that's what my parents decided was best for me.My little sister just got her degree in art which is something I would have done myself given the opportunity. I'm a very creative person. All I really want to do in life is make art, write children's books, do Cosplay Professionally, try modeling or acting or something. I'm not allowed to get to distracted with that though. I have to keep my eyes on the prize.My parents wouldn't allow me to take a year off during college. The pressure is slowly driving me insane. I have developed serious depression and they have noticed but don't care. For a while they looked for a Psychiatrist in my insurance with no luck. They gave up. They make comments about me being too sensitive because I'm always crying now. I can't sleep. I realize I have to finish school or I'll never be in their good graces. They refer to me as an investment. Meanwhile the school they forced me to go to is terrible and I spend most of the energy I have left chasing my advisers around cause they are terrible about giving proper advise. It's summer break and I still have to spend it emailing my Dean over missing credits and billing issues.Now I just want to finish so I can finally get a year to myself, to explore creative work possibilities. That doesn't work for my parents though. They want me to go straight to work as a teacher. After all those loans are going to start demanding payment. I deal with all of this on top of reoccurring sexual assault flashbacks. Now I just want to end it but I'm afraid of pain and I don't want to inconvenience anyone. I have narrowed it down to jumping. I don't know if I will hit a low enough point to do it though.
