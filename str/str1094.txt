I have struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts for most of my life. I would constantly day dream of dying and tell myself hatred words a lot. Then one time it just got worst. I couldn't keep myself together. Getting up was severely worst. I could barely keep up with life. I started to self harm and I would dissociate more. I feel so stressed and I  kept thinking of drinking bleach. It got really bad, but with help from people I met on the internet. i asked for help. I went to an out patient program because I am really afraid of hospitals. Then I started to feel like my normal self. I was still depressed and still am. I just really miss it though. It was my worst, why would I want to go back? I really don't know. My guess is I still want to die and I am just normally to afraid to do anything to harm myself. I don't like this. I'm here and i made it, i should be proud, but instead i am really sad and miss that terrible feeling. I just don't know what to do and I feel crazy.
