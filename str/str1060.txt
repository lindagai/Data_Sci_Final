hi, im 16 and have had suicidal thoughts about 10 months now. I have suicidal thoughts almost daily even if im having a good day. I just want to tell someone but when i speak of it i dont realy make it clear that im serious. I can have a good day and suddenly i think about it, just makes me want to kill myself. I realy want to cut my self, but i dont want people to notice, i once burned a burnmak on my wrist and it got too much atention, but it felt good.Sorry for the "rant" and for the bad english
