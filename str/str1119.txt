I'm not sure if it's something that I've only noticed recently, but I've seen a lot of people downplaying motivation quite a bit, and arguing that discipline is the way to go. Apparently, it started more or less with [this](http://i.imgur.com/sM00I9Q.png) post on Tumblr.Now, in some ways I *do* agree that discipline is more important then motivation in many ways. Motivation only works with things you really want to do. Discipline works for things you want and for the things you don't want to do. Sometimes, you'll need to do things despite not wanting it so discipline is definitely better on that ground. Moreover, discipline usually holds better out in the long run. Meaning that discipline is better long-term.But I don't want to completely dispel motivation. Motivation is an incentive, and can push you out of your comfort zone which can be a great deal to experience more out of your life.When you're going through depression or similar issues, motivating yourself is extremely difficult. Even reaching out for help can be a difficult thing, even though you realize you need it. When you're broken down, and stuck in that dark, bottomless pit, it can be difficult to get out of bed. Let alone doing anything long-term, which requires discipline. Instead, being motivated to get out of bed, take a shower. Maybe even walk can help. Especially at depression's worst.As I said before, I do think that discipline is more important then motivation as it's more reliable and gives structure to your life. But motivation should, in my view, not be discarded.
