Everyone around me is so much better than I am and I feel like complete garbage as well. I question why I was made to live so uselessly. Everyone else gets ahead and I've stayed the same for so long. I feel like I havent really even been living but just passing time until I fall over and die. I wish I could die but it seems impossible because I become too afraid. I wish some days that  I could catch a disease or something and actually make people care that I lived but I'm sure it wouldn't do much and no one would visit me. I would be a talking topic for a while and be left in a grave to rot.
