The pain, the frustration.It just hurts so much to just exist. I went to doctors, but they are unable to help me. It seems like the only way to help a bit would cost a lot of money, which I don't really have.I wish I could just end, but I am worried of failing and it just being so much, getting locked up in torture place, called hospital.I still have a bit hope, but is it worth the constant suffering. Being constantly ignored, having no friends, the pain, the frustration with just existing, with daily tasks?Sometimes I just hope to get worse, so I had valid reason to actually do it.
