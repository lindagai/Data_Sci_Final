Wrote this to a reply to someone's just recently. If you look at an earlier post on mine I said I would be dead in weeks plus bought 10 1P-LSD, about a week ago I took them all and hung myself, was found, certain to have brain damage, but am fine, in hospital at the moment actaully, the whole air ambulance was called and everything, I remember absolutely nothing, it's funny how I'm alive and I've never wanted to live more right now ever in my life, can't wait to get back home and get back to life, feel happy, it's very weird
