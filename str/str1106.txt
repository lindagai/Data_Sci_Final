So this is what has been going on in my life since March from last year. In that month my dad became retarded and keeps making arguments in the house, and I hate everytime I come back from school or anywhere I go I hear him shout. At school everyone doesn't even bother to talk to me, I am pushed on the hallways, and everyone insults me. The only people that I can talk to is my family members and my best friends. Because of what happened in my family I am developing a shy behavior and I refuse to talk to anybody and when I do I can barely manage eye contact. This will fuck me up in the future I bet. I'm never gonna get married or anything because of this. I'm just going to kill myself. On June 30th I'll go to a high building where I can surprisingly climb on to and jump, and not even leave a note. Before I do that I'll delete everything off my computer and every social media site. If you are still reading then you might probably somewhat care about me, but I highly doubt that. I have no reasons to live anymore. I am pale, not even socialize, and everyone is doing better with their lifes than me. I'm shy of doing social activities that include Sport classes and even being the hall monitor at school. Think I'll just jump off that building and get it over with. I'm done. Won't even leave a note because who cares about me right? I want to see if they even noticed me not being around, or if they see me there, if they say anything to keep me from jumping.
