I don't want to live anymore. I feel trapped and alone. I am generally not an overly emotional person (Haha I'm a woman I know lol) but I have been mostly bc of this news not all bc of hormones and such. Haven't really talked to a lot of people. The father isn't understanding bc he assumes it's just me being a weak hormonal woman but I need help. I am only 6 weeks along and I want an abortion but I want to die myself maybe two birds with one stone? I know I sound like a terrible person. I really have given my life to others and I love it. I just want the best for everyone else and it's hard being strong. I can't anymore. I need the help now.
