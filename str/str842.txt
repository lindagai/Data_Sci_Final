Now as a disclaimer I am NOT actually suicidal, so please do not cart me over to the suicide watch Reddit. Basically I just don't feel like I'm 100% normal. I know depression comes in many forms so that's the only reason why I'm reaching out, not because I feel like I want to end it all. But my main symptom of not feeling normal is the constant thought of killing myself. It's not thought out. It's not because I hate my life. It's not filled with detail to any degree. I just am sitting in class or driving somewhere and the random thought of me killing myself pops into my head for literally no reason at all. And this occurs generally about 3 or 4 times a day. Maybe more maybe less. Sometimes I slough it off and sometimes it takes a bit longer to get over it. But this is the main reason why I decided to post here. Another symptom (since I'm already here) is that I'm never happy with what I have. I mean, when I really sit down and think about how good my life is, I definitely can understand how blessed I've been with my life. But if I don't have the time to sit and think, I generally don't feel happy with any portion of it. Again, not hating my life, I'm a generally happy person, but when I get lost with my thoughts my mind is a dark place. I guess my point is that I feel like I have minor depression with my symptoms being thinly spread out. I thought I would post here because I've never gotten a second persons opinion on this, and it's something that I really would like to discuss with anyone. Any and all responses are welcome.
