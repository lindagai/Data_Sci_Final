I am only 18, I have failed all through grade school, and only got by with special assistance, I dropped out of high school because my brain appears to simply be unable to process the information and my motor skills are shit (my handwriting looks like a 5 year old's). I have lived in my bedroom on the computer ever since, I have no clear vision of my future and I have no talents, no job and I haven't spoken to someone outside family in years due to extreme social anxiety. To make things worse, I have been experiencing some diabetes-like symptoms for the past year, but my parents won't let me get a blood test because they think I'm afraid or something,(among other reasons I don't understand, not religious ones or anything, they actually think I'm too afraid) I am almost positive something is wrong but there's nothing I can do. So I'm just stuck in my room watching the days go by until one day I wake up blind from diabetic nerve damage or something, I just don't see the point of being alive if live is just going to keep punishing me like it has from the start, and I didn't even do anything. I really would like to commit suicide soon but I'm too much of a coward, I just have no direction or purpose and never have, I have an inferior body, brain and everything else, life is a waste of time.
