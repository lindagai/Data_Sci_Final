Doing terrible. Just started talking to this beautiful girl and she has talked to me every hour. I was supposed to give her her graduation gift today. She never responded back when I should go. I texted again and she hasn't responded. Just feeing bummed out because I've been single for a long time and been cheated on many times. I thought this was my break finally but I feel like my bad luck will get in the way like always.
