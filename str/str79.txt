Yes I sometimes can't get out of bed until 2 pm-3pm.. ugh I get mocked for not being able to get up early as well by elders. I found that art and passions in general helps me find some type of energy and hope when there isn't anything else there. But of course it can also be purely physical needs like lack of vitamins in the body etc.
