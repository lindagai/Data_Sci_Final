This is the first time someone has straight up told me I might have a point. Tbh, I haven't tried *every* treatment out there, perhaps not even many compared to the average r/depression Redditor here. It just seems that everything I look at points to this being a very stable thing. Therapy can help. Meds can help. I have read enough reviews and meta-analyses to be confident that there is something there beyond placebo, at least for up to maybe a year following treatment. The question is though, do they help enough to matter? I don't think so. Is \"not suicidal\" or \"not entirely miserable\" enough of a reason to continue living?
