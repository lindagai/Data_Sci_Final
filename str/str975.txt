We love to love. Life without love would be boring. We love people, things, landscapes, good actions, etc.But, when somebody we love SO MUCH love us SO MUCH in return, we can feel a little enslaved. I'm not thinking about suicide at the moment, but I think the idea of suicide is a really powerful one in that you always can look up to it. You can think "Ok, I'll try my best to be as happy as possible, but if I end up in this hole I can't see myself ever getting out of, if the worst I can imagine happens, I could end my life".But when someone you absolutely love loves you so much, you feel bad because you wouldn't want to cause them pain, scars that maybe wouldn't go away. So you don't feel freedom, don't see yourself as a free individual, you don't take all decisions concerning you only based on your own motivations.If you were free of others love, you will feel absolutely free, with no real fears whatsoever, because you could end suffering at any moment, you would only feel responsible for your own well-being. You will live a life or risk. You will taste life. No more hidding. No more worrying.What are your thoughts on this subject?
