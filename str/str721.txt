I don't know why i want to die. I have every reason to live but I still want to die. But it's like i'm two people - the "suicidal me" who wants to die so so so bad and the "truly me" who I think is who I actually am who doesn't want to die and wants to live. I want to live really bad but it's like...I have to fight back the "suicidal me" because if I don't it'll take control and I'll have another suicidal episode where I have to fight to keep myself from killing myself. I'm not me anymore. There's just so much pain, the "suicidal me" is in so much pain. I see my depression as two people connected at the torso, with no legs - kind of like Cat-Dog. One side is screaming and depressed and wants to kill the other side while the other side is trying to run away but it can't because it's connected to the other side. Maybe this is clinical depression, caused by a hormonal imbalances...where even though I don't want to die, I still do. Sometimes I wonder how long I'm gonna be able to hold on. No one knows this - only maybe 3 people know about my depression and only 2 of those knows that I've had suicidal thoughts...no one knows that they're back.
