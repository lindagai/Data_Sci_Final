I live in a place where everyone thinks I'm a weirdo due to my downward spiral into a deep problem with social anxiety. I act awkward and never made many real friends. Just finished college and have the opportunity to stay in the shithole I'm in or move somewhere else to study. I just wish I can find a female friend, even if just a really good friend. I doubt there'll be anyone out there who share similar interests and one that can genuinely reciprocate the love I have. I seriously think I'll die alone, I don't know how to behave normally in society anymore, and to top it off I find sanctuary in my bedroom. Being outside chokes me as I feel everyone is judging me. I really want to meet someone, but I don't think anyone will like me for who I am.I'm a 19 year old guy.
