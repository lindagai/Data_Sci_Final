You have just described my life (minus the sticking to studying). I've quit and dropped out of almost everything for the last six years. Trust me, that's not very easy either. It's left me in my mid 20's with too few competencies, no real education and no idea what I want to do with my life. But I can truly recognize the "What if I was in a car accident?"-thought. Not that I want to kill myself, because something deep inside of me wants to believe that it gets better at some point. But after 5 years of being depressed, it's freaking hard to keep up the faith in "the good life" and "everything will be sorted out in the end". Because when does it end?! It seems like never :(I can also follow your difficulties with people near you. I think people in my life are also starting to become tired of me being negative and sad. I just can't help it..
