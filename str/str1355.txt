Well, the middle ground would be maybe trying to reel yourself in a little bit. You don't have to push your friends away completely, but if you're starting to recognize that maybe a little bit too often you're leaning on your friends with your tears and always talking to them about problems, you could try to cut back. You're going from one extreme to the other, from worrying that you only think about yourself and not your friends, to thinking the solution is to only think about protecting your friends while carpet bombing your entire social life and leaving yourself with nothing. You can keep your friends while also being a thoughtful enough person to maybe recognize when to keep quiet about how you're feeling and instead make the conversation about them. Really I would try to resist that temptation to totally burn bridges. I have totally isolated myself and I haven't seen anyone in 3 years. I now understand why solitary confinement is a punishment in prison. I want to die. I feel like my heart is shriveling up from the lack of human contact and touch. What I wouldn't give to simply have a nice conversation with someone, to share a meal or go see a movie. It's possible to respect your friends and yourself at the same time. Strive to be a better friend if you think you're being too much of a burden. Don't make yourself out to be this mutant who should lock themselves away for the benefit of others. These people wouldn't be your friends if they didn't see something worthwhile in you. Do not kid yourself about what you're considering doing by cutting those ties. In a year or two you might realize what a terrible decision it was.
