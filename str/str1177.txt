This post is really me just thinking out loud but does anyone else  have a hard time holding a job? I nail the interviews and getting them when I have great nights of applying to like 30 or 40 places but after a couple of weeks I start getting depressed and antsy and I end up never showing up again, instead I end up staying in bed all day. Who has similar experiences ?
