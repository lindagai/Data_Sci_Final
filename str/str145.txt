I have done a lot of art by myself mostly designs and stuff but honestly I lost whatever interest I had in it and no longer enjoy doing it sadly. It's true that you can forget when you were happy and you are right I do remember fondness from my childhood. But ever since then (age 10/11) I have had this feeling of depression and it has only ever got worse and nothing has ever really brought me happiness.
