I agree with therapy. Honestly even those not at a suffering stage of mental health can benifit greatly from it. You are so supportive and loving for him. He needs that. Right now he might feel unloveable because he is so in the dark that he can't see correctly. One thing my husband had me do when I was suicidal is make a contract with him. It was terrifying for me because I felt so exposed and raw. It isn't a good fit for everyone but it worked for me at that time. Here's a link to one:http://www.suicide.org/no-suicide-contract-form.htmlOne thing you also need to be mindful is your own mental well being. My husband told me one of the hardest parts of being the SO to someone deeply depressed was feeling helpless and worrying. It takes a huge toll on your mind and heart. Have someone YOU can confide it as well. That doesn't mean you have to share everything about what he is going through, just how you are doing. (Again I recommend counseling for everyone.) In short to take care of someone else you also have to take care of yourself.
