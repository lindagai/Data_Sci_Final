Hi all, as I type this I'm sitting here with a stiff drink (like every other night of the week) trying to just get through another boring day of my meaningless life. Moved to a new city for work a few months ago with the though of starting fresh, making new friends, being more sociable, the rest of it. I have a good job, a nice apartment (live alone), and that's about where it ends. I have one close friend here and that's it. I've tried making new ones and even had a girl for a month or so but that didn't work out. I basically go to work, come home, eat dinner, drink, sleep, repeat. I am sick of this cycle and I'm stuck in a rut. I'm struggling to see where to go from here. Some (most?) days I just want to end it all but I don't think I could do that to my friends in my hometown and my family. I would really appreciate any words of advice. Thank you.
