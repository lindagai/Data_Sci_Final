&gt;I'm in an all-time low in my life, I can't see myself anywhere in the future, I don't want to do anything, I don't have any goals or dreams anymore, I really just want to die [...]Ive been feeling this way since I was about 14 and as soon as I opened up about it to the psychiatrist, 3 days ago, he diagnosed with symptoms of Anxiety and Major Depressive Disorder. I was prescribed with medication and am now using 25 mg of Zoloft a dayIm 15. I don't know much, but it does sound like you're depressed. Try telling the person you're most comfortable with - it doesn't have to be your parents
