It is always there no matter what. It follows me everywhere. It only ever shows itself when i'm at my weakest. It kicks my while i'm down and holds me there till it feel like its done enough. Why me and my brother? Haven't we been through enough? Why can't we just get peace? I'm just tired and sick of everything, nothing is going right...I don't want to see tomorrow. I want to just let it go and be at peace. But by giving myself peace I hurt others, but they'll be okay eventually right? I don't want it anymore nor have i ever wanted it. I was a good kid I got the grades and did sports and was great at both. I'm tired and just want to stay asleep where I know it can't get me. I have to wait though, I can't leave knowing my baby (dog) is still going strong. I won't ever do that to him. Once hes gone maybe, then it won;t bother me as much. I could just play it off like i'm going on a trip around the world and never make it back. Please don't let tomorrow come, i'm to tired to deal with it right now.
