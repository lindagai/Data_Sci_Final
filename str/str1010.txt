I hate that I can't be open to my family about being depressed, especially when it's so severe. I'm considering suicide this weekend maybe. I can't take it anymore. I'm simply just a burden to other people's lives at this point.Depression is a lot like Alzheimer's; they're not who you used to know them as. You don't know how to take care of them. Sometimes they do questionable things which causes you to lash out at them. You like to think of them as how they were before. You're watching them slowly die. Eventually, they become too much work that you put the responsibility on somebody else. Others feed into your insanity unknowingly.I'm pretty damn near the end. So if there's one thing I can follow through, I guess that'd be suicide.
