Collin was so talented. He was one of the best musicians I have ever met. He always was so kind and encouraging to everyone around him. He inspired people to not give up on their dreams. I met him in the 5th grade. I'm music class he performed the Big Mac Rap and everyone was astounded by how fast he could rap it. Fast forward to 9th grade. Freshman year. We were in the same English class. He was always so cool to me. He was a rock star in the making and we had the same taste in music. I did a presentation on one of my favorite bands at the time; Escape The Fate. (Hold your comments about my choice of music) When I was done with the presentation he started talking to me about music. I was so nervous though. I ended up embarrassing myself as I did around him frequently. Over the course of the year we started texting and I really grew to like him. It was short lived because my boyfriend at the time made me stop talking to him. Now fast forward to this year. I set aside my crippling social anxiety to go see a movie with him and another friend. He was such a good person. He was so kind to me. He was always full of life. We made plans to hang out and play video games together. But I was scared to invite him over again. The problem is, he had problems. He always thought he was so far behind his peers. He felt like he wasn't doing well enough. He just didn't see his own talent or impact he made on everyone around him. A week ago he shot himself in his car in front of a local TJ Maxx. Everyone is devastated. At his funeral there was a line stretching outside the huge church just to get in. His girlfriend was a disaster before she even got to the door. He was such an inspiration and we will never forget him. You never know how other people see you. You never know how much people love you. You never know. Rest easy friend.
