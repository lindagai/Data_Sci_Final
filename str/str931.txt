I finally took it upon myself to seek out help for my depression and anxiety. I've been falling deeper and deeper into this pit of self loathing and I have literally no motivation or ambition to do anything. I dropped out of college and I'm too anxious to actually apply anywhere for a job.I made an appointment with my family doctor and I told her about my panic attacks and worsening depression. Before I could elaborate more, she was already writing me prescriptions. She didn't ask me anything specific about how I've been feeling besides asking if I was suicidal. The entire appointment lasted literally 5 minutes and then she sent me on way.The two pills that she prescribed me were Lorazepam and Venlafaxine. I went in expecting her to maybe refer me to someone that I could talk to, not immediately put me on medication. I don't really feel comfortable taking these pills because the side affects are kind of scary, and she gave them to me so fast without really hearing me out.I would much rather try talking to someone about ways that I can  try managing it myself, rather than jumping on pills immediately. I honestly don't know what to do, should I just say fuck it and take them? or should I seek out a different professional that I can talk to? I just want to feel normal again...
