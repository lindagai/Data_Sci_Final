It's like I'm walking on eggshells whenever I talk about my genuine feelings of my future and depression. I can't tell people how much I want to kill myself because I will be sent to the hospital, but I'm holding so much in because it feels like I can't talk about suicide. My depression is now completely about suicide. It's all I can think about. I look at a bridge and I think, "wow, you think I could kill myself from that drop?" I've been googling the highest building that will give me access to their roof. I've started to amass a huge collection of Xanax, so I can mix it with large amounts of alcohol, hoping that it might kill me. Thing is, I've tried multiple antidepressants and none have helped me. I've been to therapy, and I truly felt like it was doing nothing for me, so I stopped going. I haven't talked to my friends in such a long time that I'm pretty sure they think I hate them.
