Exercise saved me from myself. I went inextricably far down the road of cynicism about society and humanity, but working out makes life much better for me. It took me out of my depression. However, exercise is one of the few things I have the motivation to do because I only ever want to be alone. I have no motivation to be a contributing member of society. The only thing I want to do with my life is work out and chill with Mary Jane. I don't care about dealing with people or their flaws or their problems. I think I'd be That Girl who gets fired from her job because she chooses to ride her bike around the city instead of going to work. That being said, I have decided to start the process of becoming a bike courier for Uber. But it's a dead end job so I can't do it forever. So what the fuck should I do? Should I go to therapy? Or should I just give myself time to grow up?
