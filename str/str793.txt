So I'm at the bar again. I'm chugging Manhattans in a vain attempt to loosen up. I was supposed to be with a meetup group; I'm looking right at them. I have intense social anxiety and can't engage though. I've embarrassed myself on three separate occasions now. I used to find it so easy to talk to people as a kid. What went wrong? Why am I like this? I want to just die to be honest. Why do people care?
