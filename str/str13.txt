I've never been employed by anyone.  All I've done is run my own little car wash/detail business at my parent's house.  I like doing that because it's relaxing, I'm my own boss, and I chose what I like to use/offer to customers.  But, since I live in CA, we have a major drought and it's only getting worse, so I really gotta conserve the water as much as I can.  It sucks because I've always loved washing cars. I don't have a degree, but I have a HS diploma and will hopefully be getting my Associate's, assuming that I passed all my classes.  So I did attend some college, but I certainly don't have a 4-year degree.
