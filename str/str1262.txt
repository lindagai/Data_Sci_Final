it already happened. he left me, and im trying really hard to have him talk to me, so we can work things out. when he said he didnt want to talk to me if everything he did made me feel like shit, i broke down. like right now my friend is at an airport, and sent me a pic of a sign that has his name on it, and i broke down again. he's the only person i ever loved like this, and i lost him. i just hope i can get him back before i kill myself or something. i posted whats going on here- https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4neewk/im_finally_coming_out_for_help/
