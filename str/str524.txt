It's too complex to dismiss Tumblr users as a whole being the \"a e s t h e t i c  depression\" types. Sure, they're out there, but there are also many people (including myself) who use Tumblr/reddit/etc who see depression as something they can relate to others with. I do not fit in anywhere tbh and depression is one of the very few things that maybe 10% of people can truly understand and relate to. I really truly despise the way some people treat depression, as if it's something to be desired. I understand the whole aesthetic thing, trying to fit in and stuff, but when it goes further, to completely romanticise depression, that's what frustrates me.
