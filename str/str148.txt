I've been to three and a half shrinks.The half was a \"Christian\" psychiatrist my parents convinced me to see shortly after I came out to them as gay.Another one didn't pick up on me even *being* gay after three one-hour sessions where I brought it up several times.One of them thought every single underlying issue was self-hatred... for being gay and therefore obsessed with appearing more masculine to make up for it. Pass.The last was like talking to a brick wall only concerned about my symptoms and side effects. Tried Zoloft with this one for a few months, but I felt foggy and even more apathetic than usual.
