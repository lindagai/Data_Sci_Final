mmm then you may have a mild form of depression after all. i think healthy minded people would never welcome death because they think of all the things they still would like to do or all the people that would miss them, but a depressed person can't muster enough to care about details like that. you'll be alright though, i've been living on the edge of "i dont really want to live but i don't really want to die" for several years now and i'm doing alright with myself despite everything. just as long as you talk to someone if it ever seems too serious to you or if you ever legitimately consider dying, you should be alright. dealing with any form of depression or even negative emotions has more to do with accepting you have them and moving past it instead of dwelling on it. i just accept that i feel the way i do, that i'm not living a normal life and that things are harder for me, and it actually makes things a bit easier. thoughts like that, it's probably about the same as a regular person thinking about strangling their boss because they hate their job. it's not really a healthy thing to have, but you wont die from it and it probably doesnt need to be taken too seriously.
