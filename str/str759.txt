Hi guys, I'm embarrassed to seek advice publicly to people I do not know and vice vera. But like I need an objective answer, I did not saw other options. I decided to end my life. The only reason I hesitate is fear for my son to take it really bad. I know he'll spend a hard time but I would at least know what should be my last words. It's nothing  compared to still have he's father alive but I think it could make a difference in his life after me. If you think you can help me I would be very grateful.ps: sorry i am speaking french.
