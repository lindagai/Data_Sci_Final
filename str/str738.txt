This is my first reddit post ever, I'm sorry it's long. I Graduated highschool a year ago, working a minwage job I hate, living with parents since then. gr8 family and seemingly decent friends, but I'm never myself around anyone. I have a lot of 21st century skills and I'm very capable, but I don't care about anything and lack any motivation.Lately I've been less sad but more numb. I don't know which is better. Girls, food, games, friends, books, music, alcohol, doesn't matter, I don't feel anything at all. I often put myself in situations where I could die easily bc it gives me a weird rush and at least I feel something.I don't think I want to kill myself but every time I shoot a gun I get some nasty thoughts and every time I drive I get crazy urges to hit trees at 100+ mph.TLDR - I don't want to die but I constantly give myself opportunities to. does anyone else do this? looking more to hear your thoughts rather than support for my own dumb problems
