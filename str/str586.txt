Hey folks,As long as I can remember Ive fought with depression. Ive made changes in my life that I thought would keep it away, but is rearing its ugly head again and now I feel lost and trapped.I think it all has to do with my direction in life. I hate my job and the career I chose is no longer one I want. I work as a system admin for a company that is completely treat my team and I like shit. We are understaffed and overworked and I just want out. For me it bad to get to this point because it means Ive tried to tough it through for far too long and have finally lost it.Like most people, I didnt know what I wanted to do in college so I chose something I was half way decent at and went from there. With my only real motivator being money, I am where I am today. I could care less about the technical field, I just want to make enough money to be comfortable (which for me is about 50-60k).Ive thought about trying a different career entirely, something more hands on, but to get to the money that I want will require time I dont have (my current bills require about 2300/month and those are fixed). This has got me feeling really trapped and not knowing what to do next.Some would say I am just having a bad day, but it seems like 75% of my days are bad days...
