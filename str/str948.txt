I made a post here a few days ago about my obsessive thoughts and I just need to rant some more I guess. I have this terrible problem where I obsess over things that happened in the past and I get ridiculously anxious until I check certain things on the internet to make sure that things are okay. I was doing pretty good today, like I was still anxious but I hadn't checked and for once I felt like I was gonna finally make it a day without checking. And then a while ago I checked. Guess what? Everything's okay, like I thought it'd be. But it's terrible, because I just keep reassuring myself and checking and it hurts so bad to have to do that. I'm petrified I'll never be able to live my life without thinking about these past events and always having to look at this shit online. I'm so god damn anxious these days I can barely eat. I'm pretty much starving myself because I feel so sick. I finally decided to eat some food earlier, and it tasted terrible, so here I am hungry and knowing I should eat but I have the worst stomach ache and I wanna vomit. I've been feeling nauseous and sick 24/7 for the past few days and it's terrible. My joints and muscles hurt and I just want to sleep.I don't think anyone believes how fucking shitty I feel. I have to rely on my mom to get medication and go to doctor visits, and I wanna go to the doctor to get help but I don't know if it'll happen. She keeps saying she'll make me an appointment and she said we can go next weekend but I honestly don't know if I can make it until then. I have friends I know I can confide in but I refuse to because I'm so embarrassed for being such a fuck up and a cry baby.I'm just bawling my eyes out right now because everything sucks so bad. I try to be as positive as I can but it's not working anymore. I just think about death all the time and I don't know what to do.Thanks for letting me rant, sorry for being such an idiot. I hope you guys are doing okay.
