I was invited by a friend to a party that he and his wife were throwing.  Don't know anything about it other than there will be a keg and it's a cookout.  I start out excited, ready to go and have my wife convinced to go (she has never met this guy because I recently met him thrugh playing in a band) and now I am sitting in a parking lot not far from his place by myself convinced I'm not going.  I'm pathetic, social anxiety gets to me and then I get like this.  Please tell me I'm not the only one that has or does this?
