The night I decided to end it my mom kissed me on the cheek and my baby brother gave me a hug.The night I decided to end it I danced with my family and laughed like everything was okay.The night I decided to end it I saw my sister cry over her broken heart and wanted so bad to fix it.The night I decided to end it I smiled and acted like I was happy and on top of the world.The night I decided to end it my best friend knew there was something wrong, but didn't know how to help.The night I decided to end it I tried to numb my pain with alcohol, but this time it didn't work.The night I decided to end it I made new friends, and reconnected with old ones.The night I decided to end it I reached out to people in pain, and tried to heal their wounds because I couldn't heal my own.The night I decided to end it I said goodbye to the people I loved the most, but they had no idea it meant goodbye forever.I'm sorry. The pain was too much.. I had to end it.
