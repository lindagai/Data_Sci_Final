This is what I hate the most. I feel emotionally dead (granted, not all the time) but still feel the desire to help and try to dissuade others from ending up in a simulation situation. It kind of hurts at times. I just find it funny how despite being in a similar situation, you show care and empathy, even if there is no emotion behind your feelings, which may or may not be the case.
