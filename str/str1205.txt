Hello redditors, I feel like there is something wrong with me while i'm takings adhd meds and I can’t distinguish if it's the meds, or its myself. Ever since I've been on adhd meds in general, I get this stressed and tight feeling, like my bones in my feel stiff, and my emotions/personality has become blunt, hammered to a wall, unable to move. My Personality and emotions; unfortunately, has taken a dull and boring turn, and I don’t like it. it’s has negatively affect my relationship with my friends and family. Yet, Overtime, I was able to slowly conquer this black dog inside me with; positive reinforcement, therapy, exercise, and a strict healthy lifestyle. Surprisingly, things has gotten much better than before I started taking these meds. However, no matter how much therapy I do, and how healthy of a person I've become, I can’t silence the mental mood swings, impulses. In social situations, I feel like I can't unwind, relax, and relate to others, it’s like an un escapable stress. In social situations, it makes me silent, unconfident, and pessimistic. Then, at certain moments, it gets me irritated, and on rare occasion, mad at people who I care about. I don't show this side of me because I want to unwind with others, something I’ve lost the begining Ive start these medications. I've tried talking with the doctors for help, but alas, it is meet to resistance and restrain. Soon i'll be going to college, and, although my medications helped me focus and manage a B-B+ in High school, I just can’t keep living like this. In summary, if anyone can relate to this, anything a lot all, I would Greatly ask for you to provide any advice or explanation to my sorrow, and if it is the medications, myself or something else that wrong. Thank you for reading.
