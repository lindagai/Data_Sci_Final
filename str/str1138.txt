I am a male and 38 years old. I have lived with clinical depression most of my life. It's informed me and held me back. An interesting thing I have noticed is that, since I have been on medication, my artistic output has fallen to zero. My story: when I was in high school, I made a goodbye tape; a cassette tape of me basically explaining why I was going to kill myself. I didn't, of course, and later went on to do lots of fun things, including graduating with an MFA and even recording a song with Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys. I was also in a few books. Things are back to being weird. But, I know that things change so rapidly and without warning. I might be back in the great life again soon.
