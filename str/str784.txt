The title pretty much says it all. I have low self-esteem anyway and have been actively working on it. After today, though, it's back to square one. I know people say, "If they stand you up, they weren't worth your time anyway," but after feeling it twice in a month I'm beginning to think it must be something with me. Both of them just stopped texting and didn't meet me at the place we agreed to meet. I feel so alone nowadays. It's like everyone is in a relationship, and I'm not. I'm only 19, so I get that I have time, but honestly, being young makes it even worse. I feel like it'll only get worse from here. It must be something with me. There has to be something wrong with me. I feel so ugly and unwanted, and I wish I could just not live life anymore. I don't want to die, but I don't want to live, either. It's a weird feeling. Weird, and depressing.
