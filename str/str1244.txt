I'm so done with everything, I'm such a failure. I don't even know why I'm telling random people on the internet about this. Anyway, I have anorexia, which fucking sucks, but recently I've started turning to bulimia, which seems to suck more because I'm gaining weight. My parents, friends and relatives are all so happy that I've started eating and putting on weight, but I hate it. I've worked on losing weight for six years, and now that's all gone because I can't control myself. My depression is worse than ever and I just want to die, and be free of food, all the horrible things in this world and all my worries.
