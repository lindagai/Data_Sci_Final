Since late 2009, I've been battling with major depressive disorder. It stems from the fact I haven't been able to find a meaningful relationship. Ever. Been on a few dates, but no sparks, no chemistry and when I have met girls I liked, I was always friend zoned. Some of those fairly, others stringing me along by saying. "I should give you a shot sometime. I bet you'd make a sweet boyfriend." But of course, nothing ever happens. Now stuck at home again, in my early 30's. Things are spiraling out of control. I'm quick to anger, I have zero attraction towards women. My work place has begun bullying me, (Refusing vacations and retaliating when I complain about it.) and my home life is boring, droll and totally unfulfilling. I have had thoughts of suicide, but never acted on them. There's still a few people I wouldn't want to hurt by doing that. Thing is though, I can't deal with this kind of pain forever. I honestly don't see myself lasting another two or three years like this. Every year has progressively gotten worse and worse and I have no idea who to talk to anymore or what to do without everyone looking at me like I'm some kind of monster. I don't really know what to expect posting this here but, who knows.
