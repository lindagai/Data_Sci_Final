I am a 20 year old male and I have repeating thoughts of death that haunt me throughout the day.It feels as if my mind is working against me. It constantly bullies me and tells me things that scare me.Everytime I exert a feminine or not-manly trait my mind convinces myself that I am gay, I am terrified that i could be gay and I don't know it. When I was little I went to an all boy school and I would sleep over at a kids house and we would watch porn together, we touched each others penises a few times, I think it was just because we were both discovering what sex was and there were no women around.Everytime I watch a movie the evil guy makes way more sense to me than the protagonist, it seems like the evil one is more down to earthI only have fun at other peoples expenses, laughing at people who are different than me or making fun of someone because they accidentally hurt themselvesThoughts of incest, murder /and suicide run throughout my head constantly, they are disgusting and horrible thoughts but I can't stop thinking about themEveryone either wants to kill me or have sex with meEverything is a lieAll men are inherently evil, modern feminism scares the shit out of me here's an article http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jul/09/women-men-better-off-without after reading it I convinced myself that In order to make the world a better place all men should be castrated at birth I do not have fun at all anymoreI didn't ask for life, why should I have to live it?People have children only to fill a void in themselves that then burdens the child.The odeopus complex is realI read an article that said all sex is rape and I believe it Religion is not real, it's a man mad concept developed in ancient Greece created to control a population for means of economic stabilitySame with the family structurePeople are never really happy they are just pretending to be or are too stupid "ignorance is bliss"Love is not real, marriage only exists for economic stability, monogamy is not natural I am evil, I used to strangle my cat when I was little I want to talk to somebody about these things but I'm too scared, I'm scared that I'm only doing it so that I burden them with these horrible thoughts so they kill themselves.I'm seeing s therapist but it doesn't seem to be helping, I just tell her what she wants to hear so she thinks she's doing her job correctly I don't want to take medicine, I've seen the horrors that antidepressants and anxiety medicines do I believe almost everything I read and hear especially the scarier it is to meI want to die, but I'm too scared to kill myself, and I know the grief it would cause to my family friends and my gf and that wouldn't be fair to do to them, but it's my life I should be able to do what I wantI want to share these thoughts with someone but I'm afraid by doing so I will depress them, i think that if I do that I will feel worsePlease help me I'm so scared
