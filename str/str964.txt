My girlfriend (whose abroad for 7 weeks this summer) and my friend are both saying they're having suicidal thoughts and the only person they think they can talk to about this is me. I honestly have no idea what to say to them and I just feel helpless and its reminding me of all the thoughts and insecurities I had a year and a half ago that almost caused me to jump out a window. They both have seen therapists before and are convinced there's nothing a therapist can do for them. I can only say "hey its going to be ok" so many times before I don't even know if I believe those words for myself. I just don't know if I can handle being everybody's stress ball.
