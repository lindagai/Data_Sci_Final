Here I am, at the beach, my absolute favorite place on this planet. Still thinking about killing myself. I'm fucking retarded or something, I'm 22 and people treat me like a fucking child. I look 18, can't hold a normal conversation, nothing. I talk too much or not enough, literally every action, movement, phrase, thing I do I run over in my head to analyze how stupid I must look. I have a girlfriend who as a person I love but can't fucking stand her sometimes. I'm not attracted to her anymore, she's like a child too. She loves me, I just don't or can't love someone. At least not right now.The thought of having to go home and deal with everything again, my job, those fucking people, I just want to end it down here at the place I love. But I'm with my family, I can't do it now. I sit on the beach alone, drunk and am happy then. But slowly I slip back into it. I just hate myself so goddamn much. And then I'll be fine, look back on these moments of weakness and hate myself even more for being such a bitch. I'm just so tired of this cycle.
