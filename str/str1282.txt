Horrible. My past still haunts me 3 years later. I used to have so many friends but I lost contact with every single one of them after moving away. Since then, I've had only one friend, and he moved away within a few months. I haven't really spoken to anybody in such a long time, excluding my family members. Failed 2 of my finals and I know that my parents are gonna be pissed off when they find out. Summer Break finally started today, but I've got no motivation to do anything anymore and I feel like I'm losing my sanity as the days go by. I don't feel like I'm the same person I used to be. Moving on to high school this Fall and I know things will only get worse. Sometimes I just wish I could die, but for whatever reason, I'm still alive. Life sucks....
