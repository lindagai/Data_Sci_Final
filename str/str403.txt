I know people care but I can't bring myself to do anything. I'm supposed to go live and be productive but my efforts are futile, what's the point? I'm going to fail my final exam today and there's nothing I can do about it. All I can do is try my best which is not much. All my friends left me and I don't know why. I guess I never had any friends, which isn't new or surprising. A few of them actively antagonize me when they see me. I'm glad they're happy. I can't stand looking at myself in the mirror anymore. I wonder if other people hate looking at me as much as I do; people criticize my clothing because its torn and baggy which is frustrating because I don't have enough money to do anything about it. I find work but I keep losing my jobs. I can never stay cheerful enough and I have problems being on time. As my clothing degrades everything just gets worse. I wonder if my ratty clothing and depressing disposition is why people don't like me. Nothing that used to cheer me up is working, I don't know what do to.
