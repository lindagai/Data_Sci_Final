I just want everything to end so that I don't have to make the decision of whether or not to impetuously quit my job and burn bridges or stay and cry my eyes out before going, pop xanax throughout the day &amp; dread following the same cycle after the brief relief the end of the work day brings. I don't know how to break the cycle and I feel like I can't complain because there are so many other people who would love to be working. If I quit, I'll be dependent on others or homeless. I don't want to burden anyone else with my mental illness anymore. Too many bills, difficult to save... I'm just done &amp; want to give up
