I've tried everything but nothing makes me happy. Love is over rated and nothing is stronger than hate for oneself. I cant live lying to myself anymore so I've decided to end my relationship with my partner. because its selfish just being with her when every day I wake up or fall asleep not wanting to exisit. I've tried so many different medications, been in hospital and even changed my doctors. Life has no meaning.
