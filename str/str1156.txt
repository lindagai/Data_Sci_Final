Greetings! I am here to tell you about a little place called Patch.  We are a gaming support group for people who suffer or have suffered from depression/anxiety/ptsd/bipolar/abuse/sexual abuse/self harm/anything.  Even if you don't suffer from any of the above, but you need to have someone to vent to, you are welcome.  This [link](https://discord.gg/0X1B9skZ7gU6i3IU) will take you to the chat room on Discord where we hang out.  Check out the #new_user channel and introduce your self.  The #ineedtotalk and #ineedtotalk_2 channels are available if you would like to talk about your problems or issues :).  if you would like something more intimate, on the right of the screen you will see people marked as listeners (blue/purple color).  You are free to pm one of them.  Each one had to complete about  10 courses on 7cupsoftea.com and a follow up test, so each one is trained and can be trusted.  Everything is confidential and no problem is too small.  If you ever need an ear, we are here.  Take care and maybe we will see you soon!Feel free to pm me on there as well
