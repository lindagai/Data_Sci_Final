I feel you... Often I am not sure whether I am missing something or if I simply have to come to terms with the fundamental aloness.Perhaps it's a bit of both. I mean we can feel connected. And it's hard to deny the importance of social relationship.But in a sense we are still alone when it comes to our perceptions and feelings and so on... we can't simply share that.Maybe we can learn to not feel lonely in spite of our aloneness.
