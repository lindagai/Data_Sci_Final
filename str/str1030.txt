I'm just looking for some advice or thoughts from other guys that might have some more life experience.So I'm going to be going to University for the second year now. While I was in high school, I dated a girl. It was the best relationship ever. I was head over heels in love with this girl. I had my own faults, I started dealing with minor depression, but being with her made things better. We dated for almost two years I think. I was always a bit of a recluse, but when dating her I ended up segregating myself from other friends. She was my connection to other people really.High School ends and she dumped me. After a month of no contact whatsoever, she comes back from vacation and ended it, saying that long distance during college would be too hard. It crushed me. Minor depression went to major. I never got diagnosed because I hid it and refused to let anyone know. I still am doing that, bottling up everything. I can't afford to let anyone know that I think about killing myself or the kinds of thoughts I have.Currently, I am back home for summer working. I made no contact to anyone from high school other than a few running buddies to train for Cross Country. My life is work, running, and sleep. And now I get a Facebook friend request from my ex. I haven't talked to her since the break up. Even thinking about her makes me panic. I don't know what to do or think. I feel like I should just fucking grow up and be over it, it was a high school relationship, why am I still hung up over it? I feel like a piece of shit. I don't know how I'll survive the summer. Any advice would be helpful I guess.
