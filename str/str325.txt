Personally, I don't get it.I helped some friends build a house last year.  I mow this church's lawn basically for free and have done so for years.  Last year, I spent every other Saturday doing chores for my elderly grandpa.  I got a shitty old rototiller running this spring so I could help this old guy plant his garden (I owed him a favor).And while I don't regret doing those things, they also don't make me feel good or happy in any way. I feel absolutely nothing about it. If doing stuff for other people and feeling miserable and empty is what life is all about, I think I'd rather just pass.
