it's all too much now. Noone cares about me. It feels like i'm not even a person anymore. I'm just a nameless freak without a job or education at 20 years old. All I want is to just disappear because living life like this is too painful. I don't deserve anyone's compassion, and I don't want to live without it. why cant i go to sleep and just never wake up
