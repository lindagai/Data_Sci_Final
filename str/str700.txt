They just keep on repeating that I need to deal with it, I need to get a job, I need to grow up.No one ever gives me actual, useful tips, like: do this kind of exercise, tell these things to people to befriend them, do this to study and learn better and such. They just keep on repeating the same crap, thinking the will help me, but they just make depressed and make think that I should just commit suicide.
