So I feel like I'm finally at the end of my rope, I'm 22 and I've just realised I've got no further to go in my life.I'm currently working part time at my aunts cafe and have been for 5 years. That's about as close to a "real job" as I can get and every second I'm in there I want to kill myself, I hate it. I DJ part time and I love doing that, it's a real escape for me but I no longer have the motivation or energy for it, I feel like it's a big waste of time.I failed college which was just another disappointment and my parents get on and on at me to "sort my life out" but without any qualifications I don't think I can get a job I'd actually be happy to do, working at the cafe is bad enough, it's gotten to the stage where I'm having full blown nightmares about going to work.I can't sleep at night because I worry to much, I'm up 'til 6am regularly just anxiously tossing and turning which is leading me to be completely lethargic during the day.I feel completely lost and every single day I'm contemplating how to end my life, causing the least amount of upset to my loved ones.I've lost all happiness, I don't have anyone or anything which actually makes me happy anymore I've just lost interest in everything. I don't even want to get help, I want to WANT to die. It's hard to explain. Anyway, I'm not really expecting a response, I just came on here to vent because once again I've had my father sit me down and tell me how much of a disappointment I am.
