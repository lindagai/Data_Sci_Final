I lie, I'm full of anxiety. I feel like I'm not respected. I jerk off, I love alcohol, I like bullshit. I can't hold a job, can't hold career, can't commit to anything. I failed out college 4 times, I failed in 2 jobs, I failed in 4 relationship, neither one lasting more then 4 months. I live my parents, I lie to them in their face, I don't show any compassion, love our support. I'm angry, I'm afraid, lower back is in constant pain, I smoke weed. I drive endlessly, I'm out of work, my parents are dying, one has cancer other has bypass. Only child i am, worrisome I do. I'm a scumbag when I look at women... These are thoughts of a Paranoia guy. Thank You
