During the past four years, my laziness and typical lack of motivation has turned into self-hate. I've always been outgoing and I still hang out with a few of my close friends. I try to dress well and my job is fine. I function. In fact, I'm the kind of person that just wants to make people laugh and most people do. But when I'm alone I feel completely hopeless and just relentlessly ashamed. Life for the past 2 years has felt like an ongoing cringe moment. I can't seem to shake the inevitable conversation with myself at every moment i'm alone with my thoughts. I tell myself the most awful shit. I think about suicide everyday. I've laid in bed,calculating plans in my head and focusing on the details. But I'd never do it. I've honestly never come close to trying. Only beacuse I couldn't do that to the people around me. But the thoughts continue. I still feel this everyday.Recently I told a member of my family about my depression. I felt really embarrassed and initially regretted saying anything. I still feel embarrassed about it but I agreed to see a doctor this summer. I've never reached out to anyone about my depression before and I don't really know what to expect. Maybe its not depression and its something I can work out on my own. I'm just really nervous now that someone knowns and I can't pretend to be fine anymore. fuck. Thanks for reading.
