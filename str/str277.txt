Why would I want to celebrate an existence I wish I could opt out of right now?I hate the phrase \"happy birthday\".I hate that it makes me feel awkward about my own and anyone else's birthday.The idea behind celebrating birthdays may have been altruistic (I've no idea) but honestly it's just another day in the grand scheme of things. The only \"good\" that could arise out of it is possibly getting gifts and even then, wow you have to wait a year to get shallow attention from people who wouldn't often regard you anyway (speaking from experience in a social crowded setting like school), and getting gifts makes you obligated to get those who gave you ones some and why do you have to wait a specific day to give one a gift? Can you not do that simply because you care? Not because it appears customary.Sorry if it sounds a bit of a rant but I hate the unnecessary obligation that accompanies social concepts like this.
