Why am I do insecure? Why do I feel so lonely even though I have friends, and a girlfriend. Why do I feel like it's impossible for someone to love me, even though people day they do love me. I feel like everything is fake, and that in reality I'm a piece of shit nobody could love. I can't believe anything good, but I'm so fast to believe the worst shit. Why do my insecurites break me apart? They drain my desires. I feel like so many things are virtually pointless. I just want to feel prolonged happiness. I'm tired of living in my sadness and insecurites. Thinking I don't deserve anything, and that everything good in my life is not real and will never last. I love her, and it scares the shit out of me to think about losing her, but I feel like I will becuase I'm destined for this life of misery.
