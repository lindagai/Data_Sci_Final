I've been dealing with self- hatred for a while now. I can never do anything right whether it be academics or hobbies or talking to people. Speaking of, I have major anxiety issues and can barely talk to my closest friends without getting nervous. My girlfriend is leaving for two months and wants to end the relationship before then. She made me happy, kept me anchored. Now I ducked it all up, my best friend hates my and I'm sure my girlfriend has little to no feelings for me and on top of that I'm a worthless waste of fucking space and I want to die
