Hi everyone! I am the the owner of a modded minecraft server named Hussworld. We have been working with /r/GFD to provide a home for Minecrafters who are bored with vanilla servers, but don't want to join an over populated server with little sense of community. We are small, friendly group made up of real life friends and friends we have met online through the minecraft forum and reddit etc. We play a custom modpack called Husscraft, if you are interested in joining, I will send you a private message with full instructions and download links. The server is whitelisted, and has protection plugins, but this has never been a problem as everyone is friendly and only interested in buildong a great minecraft community!Please comment here or PM me if you would like to join or have any questions you would like to ask me. I hope to see you in Huss Town soon!
