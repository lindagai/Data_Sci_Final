Humour and generally making a joke out of everything. I'm the clown, people laugh with me, at things I say, and even at me if I want to. The laughter of others is proof that they \"approve\" of me and it makes me feel better. I have done this for as long as I can remember, even as a kid.In humour I found a way to connect to people I otherwise wouldn't be able to relate to.
