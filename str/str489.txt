Hey,I think I know what you mean to some degree.  I have trouble with creation for similar reasons, because I feel like everything I come up with is derivative.  The only way I can sometimes get past it is to realize that there's not much out there that isn't derivative work in some ways, if you go back far enough. You might say it's more likely to get a repeated game of Solitaire than a completely original idea.  No, I feel like the originality comes from YOUR take on something.  Even if your work is based off of others, what YOU do with it is unique because it's YOUR creation, your interpretation.  I know it's usually more complicated than that, but that's just my thought.
