Hmm I can't say I know for sure but I don't think it has to with being suicidal but you just stuck in thoughts maybe? I'm not 100% sure but when I used to walk home &amp; crossed streets, there are usually  cars coming in my direction &amp; in my head I was hoping they would swerve into me. That's just my experience. Anyway I wish you the best of luck
