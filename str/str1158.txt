One day, she told me, after I suggested that I come over to spend time with her, that I couldn't, but, in her words, "I'd love you to." Then she said she wanted to tell me something, and suddenly changed her mind. I had the feeling she wanted to say "I love you" for the first time, but was scared to. Eventually, I talked her into trusting me enough to tell me anything, and she said it. I told her I loved her too. And I meant it. I meant it then and I meant it every time I said it to her after that.Ever since then, we've grown closer together. We would text everyday, compliment each other constantly, etc. She continually assured me that she wanted to be with me forever, and I let her know that I returned the sentiment. She was accepting of me and my flaws and made me feel good about myself. She made me feel loved, and I didn't see any reason we wouldn't be together for the foreseeable future.We didn't get into an argument or anything when she stopped texting me. She also won't answer my phone calls or has blocked my phone number. I'm beyond devastated. I don't know what I did wrong. She seemed so sweet and so caring. Like she didn't have a malicious bone in her body, and even if she didn't want to be with me or something, she'd let me down easy.I can't deal with this. I don't have anything or anyone to turn to right now. I just decided to check out her Reddit user page on a whim, since she recently broke her phone, and said that she had been trying to remember her Reddit password to message me, but couldn't find it. It's almost 1 AM where I live. My friends (both of them) are asleep, and so is anyone in my family who I could turn to.I suffer from severe depression and anxiety, and was actually doing a little better lately. Then, when I saw her r4r post, I went from 0 to panic attack in about a second.I don't know what to do.
