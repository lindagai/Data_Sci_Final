It's a bit high for the area I live in, but not unheard of. Programmer salaries can go well into 6 figures in a major city, but I live in Ohio lol. I was CTO for the last company I worked at and made $80k, so it's a nice bump up in salary. The recruiter said they pay well in an effort to keep people around. He said they cover like 90% of insurance costs and pay for lunch every day. We'll see, I'm skeptical but hopeful.
