I had an internet friend for years I always played videogames with. We're still friends and when we talk it's always really nice, but since we've grown up we don't really talk very often. But now since we've been adults for a little while now, that means the friendship doesn't have to be internet. I can fly to his state and stay with him for a weekend if I wanted to or he could do the same. The world gets smaller so internet friendships seems to fizzle out or evolve, long distance friendships are tricky to keep going.
