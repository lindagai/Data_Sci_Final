I hope :( it might be too late by then, I might become homeless. Then I won't have an address so I wouldn't be able to get a job. I just want to end it almost but I don't even have the strength to kill myself. And McDonald's over here is worried about the safety of the students and don't want to get sued because some kid burned himself on the fryer
