Last time for me was when my dad yelled at me for something stupid I did which I can't remember. For me it's always been slightly disappointing someone. They expect something from you, even something small and if I can't live up that, I feel fucking awful.I used to be sensitive but bullying made me grow a thick skin... And learn to just bottle up emotions and not trust anyone.
