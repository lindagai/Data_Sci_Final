Hello anyone who has the time or will to read the possible wall of text that's going to cover this entire page.I am a sixteen (16) year old male who lives in Sweden, Europe.I have green eyes and cendre hair.None of this should matter to you, just want to paint a picture of what I'd possibly look like. Makes it easier for you to care about all the coming complaints and whine.I am extremely lonely, now, you might think that means I don't have any friends, which is not true.I have alot of friends, and even though I'm shy when starting conversations with new people, I often don't have too much trouble making people laugh or keep the conversation flowing with other people that I've known for a small while (or longer).I'm far from a social butterfly, but I'm not a total shut-in either.Anyways, by extremely lonely I mean that even though I have "friends" everything just feels so plastic, so extremely fake.Like I'm following a script, and all the others are just actors, we talk, we laugh, but It doesn't feel like there are any real emotions.I just say what the others would expect me to say, I'd like to think of myself as a chameleon of sorts, this might sound cringeworthy to you, as it does to me, but I can't find any other way to explain it.I get a basic idea of what kind of person I'm talking to and then I change my mindset completely, talking to a sports guy? Come up with some bullshit about a football game you saw some years ago.Talk to a gamer? Bullshit about some funny event that happened when you were playing.I know nothing of football, and the event never happened, but it makes others like me, because they laugh and/or agree.And even though I have an easy time making friends, I have the hardest time getting a girlfriend.Here comes the usual "I don't look that bad and I'm a nice guy", which is mostly true, I joke with the girls, I talk with the girls, I make them laugh and I get their attention, but no one seems interested in going that extra bit, Hell, If I'm not the one starting the conversation they usually never talk to me, I'm not sure what that is, I honestly don't look bad.I am kind of quiet when I'm around strangers or anything, but I'm center of attention with people I know a little about.I haven't had a "real" girlfriend since I was 11-ish years old, also the time I got my first kiss, but since then I've never been in a real relationship where we talk or hang out, and since 3 years back I haven't been in any relationship at all.That annoys me the most, I have so much love to give and I have no one to give it to, it feels really bad.The second thing that annoys me the most is most definetely the fact that I feel like a spectator of sorts, or an "NPC" (Non playable character, it's a game term), I can easily talk to people and befriend them, but they almost never want to do anything, we meet in school, we talk, we laugh, we have a good time, we go our separate ways.Hell, my best "friend" since I started school has only had me over twice, in my entire lifetime I've only been at my best friends house two times.Sure, I get to tag along with the usual gang I hang with when theres a movie night or whatever, but I never feel like they actually thought "Hey, this guy is nice, he should follow" more of a "Well, he's part of our gang, so I guess he gets to come".Like I'm not a real person.I've become more and more introverted, I'd rather stay at home than go out because it's never real.I feel like someones pulling the strings and that I am in no control of anything at all.It's gone so far that the only thing that keeps me from breaking down and crying at night is thinking of grotesque and "awesome" ways of killing myself.I want to get as much attention as possible when I kill myself.I've been thinking about pouring gasoline on myself and set myself on fire before walking into class, that's sure to get some attention or admiration for going through with such a gruesome way to kill myself, I've also fantasized about stabbing myself in the heart and just bleeding to death, or slitting my own throat in class.Shooting myself just feels plain boring, and that everyone would just forget about me after a while.Inb4 "Attentionwhore"I've never craved attention, I've never forced myself upon anyone, I have always been ridiculously humble, going so far that when we had been at a school trip I got offered a ride home by what had previously been a total stranger, but that I befriended rather easily during the bus trip and way back, but I kept declining, saying it was impolite, it got rather embarrassing after a while, but I stood my ground and said I'd rather walk home through the night, which I did. ( I still get a little flak for that, but in a joking way)I feel like I've been blessed with this gift, of being an easily likeable guy, but I also feel cursed, that I will always just be... Insignific.So after feeling so replaceable, so expendable for sixteen years, is it really so weird to want to go out in such a way that no one I know will ever forget me?I want to be remembered, not something that the edgy kids on the internet joke about (For example: Oh what a faggot, lol, probably killed himself for some dumb reason, probably deserved it) without even knowing me.I am starting to think I am deeply sick in the fucking head.The only thing that's keeping me alive is most likely my family, I have a barely 11 year old brother who would most likely be scarred for the rest of his life if his older brother set himself ablaze in school or my poor mother, who already have two kids with problems (One with Aspergers and one with ADHD) or my father, who I am pretty sure is mostly disappointed with me now because all I do is sit inside, but I am actually pretty sure he'd be sad if I murdered myself.Thanks for reading, usually when I post here with other accounts people are easily turned away by the wall of texts I post, so if you actually read this, thank you, If I could, I'd give you a prize, or money, or whatever. But all I can give you is a thanks.Edit: When reading this after posting I just realized how much of a bloated mess it is, so I'd like to give whoever read it an extra thanks for being able to follow through.
