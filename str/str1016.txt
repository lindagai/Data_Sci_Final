My life is shitty, she treats me like shit.My father at least treats me better.My parents never asked me id I was happy, never cared if I wanted to live, never cared of my dreams, never cared what mattered to me more than what should matter in their opinion.My mother even doesn't want to give me money on trainings.My father always gave me, but if mother tells him not to do it he doesn't.My mother is PE teacher, she complains about that job but she knows shit about being tired.Even being a student is harder and wearing fucking leaflets.Being an athlete is my only ambition, but my mother would rather let me die of boredoom.My parents took responsibility 19 years ago and they should care about my hapiness.The only thing they do is they give me a food etc.I wouldn't eat breakfasts etc. only dinner if they gave me the money on trainings or on party.I want to die rather than work in something boring until I will be an old man
