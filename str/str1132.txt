So, I may have my own problems relating to feeling down or another post I made concerning work and other things in my life that are upsetting me I recently made, but nothing compares to my sister.  She is 32, a highly intelligent individual, had a career that tanked and forced to deal with some shit that no one should have to deal with thrown her way and now it is like having a child in the house.  She is usually in tears every day at her own helplessness and inability to help herself.  I feel terrible for her and I don't know what to do.  My mother is at her wits end, and she cannot handle my sister any longer.  My sister won't even leave the house on her own anymore, someone has to accompany her.  She won't drive anywhere, nor will she walk down the street on her own without one of us to accompany her.  I know she has sought professional help etc, and has dismissed them and right now I may feel depressed at times, a lot of the time but she is another thing altogether that needs help desperately.  Just yesterday she said she would be "better off dead", what can i say to that?  i don't think she is truly suicidal but may have thoughts along those lines.  What do I do at this point?
