Birthday has always been a cursed day for me.  I hate, actively try to avoid telling people about and just wish it would pass by like any other day.  Usually ends biggest crash and can't fall asleep fast enough to overcome my emotions in how little I accomplished.  Birthday is in a few weeks, a lot of things are not going my way this year so I feel its going to be particularly rough.
