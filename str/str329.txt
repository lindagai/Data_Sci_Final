that's not just depression- that's anxiety.  (and you arent wrong about the first two. with then dealing with Anxiety and depression make life feel impossible) you need to address the anxiety first. I would suggest getting away from it all. there are lot of slower quiet jobs that you might enjoy like park ranger. or work at a nature preserve. you need less hustle; more peace. more time to contemplate - more quiet.
