There isn't much more to say. I'm not suicidal in the sense that there is a possibility that I will kill myself. If I thought this should be in /r/suicidewatch I'd have posted it there. Really.But every day is lonelier and more empty and helpless than the last. There's Wellbutrin and Effexor, which helped initially, but not anymore, so I'm meeting with my psychiatrist next week to talk about that aspect of things. Mostly I can't wake up or fall asleep, I feel like no one listens, I'm exhausted from faking it 'til I make it to get through the work day and most social interactions. It just isn't worth it anymore.BUTThe contemplation of nonexistence is terrifying, almost paralyzing. I'm an atheist and see only evidence of the cessation of consciousness at or very shortly after biological death. I can accept that I'll die some day, by illness or accident or even murder. I mean, it's still scary, but the idea of doing it myself, of knowing when and how and planning it and having all that time to actually contemplate it, that part is horrifying.So, I don't want to live and I don't want to die.
