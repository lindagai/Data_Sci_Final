I feel completely and utterly the same way. I just have no motivation for anything anymore. I wish everything was different. I wish I had the motivation I used too. Honestly, I wish I could just die. Would make everything easier for me and those around me, I am not only bringing myself down, but now also everyone around me. People tend to stay away from me now, even the girl whom I care the most about and truly love told me she loves me, but never wants a relationship with me, because we aren't happy together. Although right after that she said we have amazing times when we are together. I just wish I could disappear and never look back.What am I doing that made me want this. I wish I cared about myself, but I can't, no matter what I do. The only thing I can care about is this Girl. And I cant even do that head on anymore. Honestly, I have been suffering from depression for the last 7 years of my life. And it had it's ups and its had its downs, although right now I feel like I am at an all time low. I just want to stop feeling like this. I want to be happy. I want to be normal...
