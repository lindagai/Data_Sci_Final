She has knowledge of the fact I'm depressed and knows I take anti-depressants (recently switched from sertraline to citalopram) but she doesn't really understand it. Every year around this time she gets mad at me for not having a job (I'm 20) and we end up having this heated family intervention where they tell me I'm not trying hard enough and they can't go on living with me like this.At some point she was criticising my sleep pattern and I said I'd mentioned it to a doctor but they had bigger fish to try. She asked what and I spat out "maybe the fact I wanted to die?" She just put her head in her hands and said she didn't know what to say, and then that she didn't understand it. I'm really worried she thinks I'm making it up as yet another excuse to not have a job. The reason I don't is because I'm terrified of the whole process of job searching (deep rooted social anxiety shit), but she also doesn't understand that and it's hard to communicate my feelings about it.My suicidal thoughts aren't serious and they only happen periodically, it's just thoughts like "I want to die" and "what's the fucking point in going on" over and over again without any actual intention of ending my life. Sometimes she won't stop criticising everything I'm doing wrong with my life, telling me I'm existing rather than living and that I'm not putting in any effort to help myself, when she doesn't know just how fucking hard it is and how little motivation I have to do anything whatsoever.She went out a few minutes later and I can already smell one of those fucking interventions coming where they'll tell me how hard it is for them and my dad will probably tell me to go live in a hotel if I want to keep living like this. They refuse to try and understand and I can't listen to them talk about it without getting defensive and shouting, which just makes things worse. I don't want this anymore...Please don't move this to r/SuicideWatch, I don't plan to kill myself and I'm not experiencing suicidal thoughts right now, they're just relevant to this situation.
