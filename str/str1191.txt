Edit: I just read your responses. Thank you very much, gfd. It's really comforting. I'm not really sure what the subject matter of this post is. Vent I guess. She's been battling small cell lung and liver cancer since February. She did 3 months of chemo that she took like a champ. She was in decent health for a while. The last month, things started going downhill. I didn't want to accept what was coming, so I kept telling myself she was just under the weather and that she'd recover. That didn't happen. She's been here since Wednesday. Saturday was the last day she's been awake. She's been asleep since Saturday night. I guess she's making up for all the nights I kept her up worrying about me. I hate to say shit like this, but I'm pretty sure I'm old enough to be your dad in this sub. I'm 38. My mom had me when she was 36, she's 73 now. My girlfriend and I have been taking care of her together for just over 3 years now. She's been battling depression since they used to drill holes in your skull for it :p it was hard for her to find happiness. She wanted to be happy by seeing my brother and I happy, but that never really came to fruition. I've finally started to get my shit together over the last year. I haven't had a drink in 13 months (following what was essentially an 8 year binge), haven't had a cigarette in even longer. I self medicate with weed, but I don't consider that too self destructive. I quit my anti depressants cold turkey a while back (NEVER DO THAT). I landed a job at where I plan to retire from when the time comes. I've lost 7 lbs over the last month, and I'm trying to focus on becoming healthier. This paragraph is being written about 7 hours after the above text. My mom passed peacefully today. My brother and another close family friend were there. I'm not really sure how to feel. All I feel is tired.
