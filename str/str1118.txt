Getting it out there is a first step to commitment. So I'm getting it out there. I'm going biking today, don't give a shit about the weather (it's probably going to be nice out). The hardest part is getting started, taking that first step, and I just need some friendly internet-person to give me a poke. Say "you should definitely go biking today" or "I'll say boo if you don't bike today" (but nothing more than boo - patience). History below, in case there's something relevant there.And...I'm new here. First post, yay. I've been taking Cipralex (escitalopram) for an unrelated anxiety issue for about two years, but now...I just feel like I'm dying inside. I don't feel well-rested unless I've gotten 10-12 hours sleep and I'm doing nothing the rest of the day. Going anywhere exhausts me. Which is trouble, because of school and work (5:45 wake-up call, yay!).Well, I first started feeling really "depressed" in the middle of last term (October). I stopped my hobbies (photography) because I couldn't muster up the energy, tricked myself into thinking energy drinks would help. I'd go zombie my way through school, losing marks along the way. Then this summer, work was hard physical stuff. I switched to a desk job after a month. I also switched to a gigantic horse-pill of that Cipralex. I used to love biking. In fact, I could ride across town hardly breaking a sweat. Got good gear, planned to do some long road trips for fun. Then I went into university, gained a bunch of weight, started having knee problems, things went downhill. Knee problems threatening to come back, but screw that. I'll bike until I can't any more.
