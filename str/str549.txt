I reached a point where i just can't believe if somebody says something positive about me. That every action a friend does its against me. Feeling aislated every time i join a group. Im 26, no job. No finished studies. I can't just love myself a little, i end feeling like garbage and i can't find anymore motivation to do things i enjoyed before. Im afraid of losing people and at the same time that this fear ends provoking that. And im desesperated, i don't know what to do with my life anymore. Except crying for help.
