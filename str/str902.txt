I do. I just can't imagine that things will get better enough for me. Like, I honestly can't see myself living past September. Part of my reasoning being is that I'm stuck in a town that I very much do not like. I've been trying to save up money for a car, but I've been hardly getting any paying work. My dad said that he's gonna come visit in September, but if he can't help me get out of this place, I will kill myself. I just can't handle being here, anymore. I'm so unhappy. I don't have any friends. There's no opportunity out here. I've been looking for full time jobs to apply for, but most of the jobs require some sort of degree(I went to a trade school) or experience with a program I don't have, let alone can afford.I dunno what else to do. It's like I've been given only a few months left to live and no matter what I do, I can't seem to get out of this situation.
