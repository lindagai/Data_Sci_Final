I dont really.  I work in a factory and im somewhat isolated.  Its deafening and smells like poison.  Sometimes I go outside for \"fresh\" air... but we are next to the waste treatment plant.  So..n literally smells like piss and shit.  It can be arduous, boring , excruciating pain.  I get by with taking notes writing stories about depression.  I steal from you guys.  No remorse.   Yeah mostly escape ism.  Crying right at my machine not even trying to hide it.  People don't ask how im doing anymore and my supervisor avoids me.
