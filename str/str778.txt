It's a bit difficult to explain, but I honestly believe I am going to do it. I don't see my mind changing, I've already planned the scenario, I know who I'm calling before I do it, I know how and where I'm going to do it, and I know to call the clean up crew. Anytime I think if my future, I just don't see it. It's black, there's nothing there. With my declining health, my degree meaning nothing, no job ever accepting me, and a lover being a fantasy, I just don't see how I'm going to grow up happy. It's a fallacy at this point and when I dream of happy scenarios, it hurts, cause happy dreams are just fantasies at this point. I'll likely make a last post someday once I get the courage to do it.  If you guys got any good songs as a last listening, that'd be great. And before someone says "It always gets better". For some people, it simply doesn't.
