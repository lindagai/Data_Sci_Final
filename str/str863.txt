My life right now literally has zero meaning, besides family that would be sad i literally do not benefit anything to this world, since I was younger ive always been excluded from society. After growing up through school which is probably the only happy part to my life. Im growing to be an adult soon and now I realize there really is nothing for me. No where I belong or even want to belong. Dreams, goals, etc. Ive done all those steps. Now im at a point where i feel like my wants are meaningless. For once I feel weird that I actually don't want to live, when before i used to always want help. The more i study myself; i feel like im already insane. That I can become anyone I want to be because I don't care about anything anymore. I can lie to myself, live through life following everyone, use everyone, minipulate everyone without a single care in the world, which i feel like its the only way I can stay alive.I've had depression for years, oftenly increasing throughout the years. To the point where I let everything go to be free, at first i thought it be a revelation to live hate free, but at last; im actually empty-er than ive ever been. After being so unconnected with the world and often left alone, it already grew on me how much I hate the world. so enough with all the fear I had because all of my speculations turn out to be true. Life is harsh, its meant to be. But it's late for me to feel sentimental toward anyone anymore, I feel like im pretty much a spirit or something. So do I die?, should I do what I really should do, or should I live by continuing lieing to myself and live in my own fantasies?
