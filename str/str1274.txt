I smoke to relieve stress too but I regret it. Im 22 y.o. and I started when I was 15. Smoking really helped me because it seemed to have boosted some of my self esteem when I was hanging out alone at school and just to relieve stress. Now I cant stop smoking and my back hurts every morning and some time. I have big regrets like I feel like I could die very very early. It really crushed some of my hopes for a good life. My tip is dont be too dependent or else you could only be happy whenever you light one.
