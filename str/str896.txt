0. I'm 22 in college.1. I've done horrible things in the past, I can't live with myself. I hate everything about myself.2. I screwed everything up to the point where I lead a very shitty life, I hate my life. It's unbearable.3. I have no family or friends that are willing to help me. I'm good at nothing and the only girl I loved literally flipped me off. I have nothing going on for me, I'm nobody.4. My exam results should be out in a few days, and if I fail this year like I usually do, I'm going to kill myself.5. To clear this up, I fail not because I'm stupid, because all the shit I've been through in my life fucked with my brain. I can not process and think clearly anymore.6. I've tried killing myself several times in the past and I either failed or chickened because the method was painful.7. I want someone to tell me how to do it painlessly, and with nearly zero budget, because obviously I have no fucking money.8. Unless you are willing to adopt me and help me start a new life, don't tell me not to kill myself, because I DO NOT want to live this shitty life anymore, It's been years and years and I can't take it anymore.9. Thanks!
