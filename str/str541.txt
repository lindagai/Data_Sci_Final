First time post here so forgive me if I'm posting in the wrong place or format. I've been struggling with ppd (postpartum depression) and anxiety for a year now since I had my second son. I've been on zoloft 45mg for the majority of the time and I've been pretty consistent with it except a little lapse lately when my phone was destroyed and I didn't didn't have my alarm reminder. Even  when I was perfectly consistent I would still have boughts of high anxiety and depression which would leave me laying on the floor more or less not able to get up to play with my kids (3 and 1.5 years old). The majority of the time it's not that bad but when it happens I feel like the worst mother in the world. My older son will come up to me and say \"mommy sad? Want daddy? It's ok\" and pat my back. Then I feel even worse because I'm supposed to be his rock not the other way around. I need to get a blood draw to check levels soon and check in again with my doctor but I was wondering if anyone had tips for dealing with kids and the endless needs that put me totally over the edge. I end up feeling so hopeless and helpless and frustrated. I dealing end up getting overly mad at my kids and become a mom I don't want them to have. And I know this will all pass but the mean time is so hard to do. It's unbearable at times and I can't enjoy my family.
