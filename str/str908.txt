Does anyone else get like this when experiencing a death of a family member or close friend? This is the closest person to me that has ever passed. In my mind, I imagined that one day I'd be successful and be able to lavish my grandma with nice gifts and take her to Vegas whenever (she loved to play slots), now that will never happen. I always imagined she'd be there to meet my future children, now that will never happen. If I had been more focused in high school and actually completed college, I know I would have been able to do so much more for her. Since she passed away, I stopped using social media, stopped answering my cell phone or replying to txts. The only people I've been talking with are my SO (we live together) and my mom because she gets really concerned if I don't answer her calls for more than 2 days. I don't want to exist right now, so I just withdraw further and further away from people around me. I just wish there was a way to decide to no longer be a part of society. I want to walk away from my entire life, my job, my family, my friends, my apartment, &amp; just say fuck everything. I've fantasized about just living among the homeless and whatever happens, happens. Not entirely sure why I'm posting this, just felt like letting SOMEONE know how I feel.
