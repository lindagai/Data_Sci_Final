Started at 13/14 I guess. Things weren't going my way. I started to sink inside. Eventually I got tired of it and moved schools at 14. Helped for the first couple months and then got worse again, and now I'm on antidepressants. Haven't helped yet. I really just want to die. I did get a puppy two weeks ago and he's amazing but I still want to die.
