Man I love rain so much because it kinda symbolizes my depression. Its dark, and its gloomy, but its there and weve accepted its a part of life. I dont think that my depression will ever get better- but im not so upset about it anymore. One day ill kill myself and that doesnt bother me so much anymore. Its just a part of my life that ive come to accept, like rain.
