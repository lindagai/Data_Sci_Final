Oh, you asked for advice though! Hmm... Deep breathing is the most basic (inhale deeply and hold 3-4 seconds before releasing) and slows your heart beat and anxiety. And if you're with her during the breakdown, I'd imagine she could do a lot to comfort you. If she needs advice, just tell her to message me. I'd rather not go through you because that might lessen the impact of what she does. As for you coping yourself, you could also try grounding yourself in reality. That's where you look around in your surroundings and look for 10 specific details. Color, texture, smell, taste of food, little things like the shapes in carvings. If you like drawing or writing, you could also try that. Then there's always venting on here since its unlikely anyone will judge you (negatively, anyway).
