Thats a bummer, I hope your life becomes less of a curse. I don't care about how I leave the world, Ill be dead anyway so no worries there. I just don't want to die yet. I still have hope. A shotgun blast to blow my sick brain out of my skull will always be an option for me I think. Eternal nothingness is probably my biggest deterrent.
