So I like to shoot pool every saturday and there is this really cute waitress I had my eye on for months. The last time I saw her she smiled a lot and was flirting with me (I think) Now I havent seen her for a few weeks but tonight I saw her come in with a couple of friends. I get excited cause I already thought of a good couple of topics to talk to her about. I finish a game and  destroying my opponent 8-1 and was really feeling good about myself. Thats when I notice a guy completly touching every inch of her ass. I swear if there wasnt any trance muzak playing you could hear glass breaking. From that moment on I lost 6 straight games before I called it quits and went home. Please share your stories to help me feel a little better.
