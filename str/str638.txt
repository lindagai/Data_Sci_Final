Yeah, I try to remind myself that I'm not as terrible or worthless as my depression makes myself out to be. Some days I can tune out the self-hate, other days I feel like I deserve to die. Thank you for the kind words and empathy. I do feel accustomed to my depression somewhat, some days are just worse than others and I find myself struggling to cope.
