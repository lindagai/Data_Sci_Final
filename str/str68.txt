Often times I feel myself sharing the exact thought, but I've found things that have helped me through it. Various small hobbies, intoxication, etc. While most days they seem meaningless and more trouble than they are worth, those small moments where they are positive really help to give me a harbor to sit through the storm on.Another thing I've done recently is since I have noticed my life is filled with emotional hardships, being able to devote myself to helping others has been a thing of beauty for me. Even though life is still hard, being able to waste my time making others lives better is much better than simply wasting away on my own.(These are just things i've been doing though, so don't expect them to transfer directly over, but who knows, helping people as a possible means of helping yourself could be something that might work for you)
