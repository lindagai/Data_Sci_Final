I feel that, for parents, sometimes they're so troubled by the fact that their child is going through something as major as depression that they try to handle it by not handling it. What I mean is, they prefer to undermine and not acknowledge the issue rather than address it directly because that would mean they have to face it. What I can tell you, however, is that being suicidal is NOT and i repeat NOT weak at all. Issues that your family might have had and overcame do not effect you or your current struggles. You are not weak for anything you might feel, and I understand and sympathize with you greatly.
