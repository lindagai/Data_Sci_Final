I know exactly what's causing my depression but I can't do anything about it.  I know for a fact that my depression stems from my being unable to live in the present moment but knowing that doesn't make it better.  I am either longing for the carefree days of my past or worrying about the uncertainties of the future.  I don't have much in common with other kids my age which only makes me more anxious in social settings.  I feel like I am a child trapped in an adult's body.  This inability to stay in the present really messes with my concentration and getting things done on time.  Will I ever be able to overcome this?
