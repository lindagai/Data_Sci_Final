One thing I will say about being alone and in your 30s with nothing accomplished, and I gave it my best, believe me. Having said you probably have given it your best so far and life has probably said 'fuck it' and kicked you while your down. The thing is you need the motivation and it has to be something you really want. Case in point, I've learned the hard way that I really don't need anyone or anything and I am better off alone. I've always felt out of place and I am tired of stepping outside of my comfort zone and getting shit on all the time. When you face constant rejection, it kind of puts a serious damper on what little shred of desire you had for meeting people in the first place. Only place in my life I have never felt out of place is the Sanctioned Suicide sub, but that's a whole other reason for me. I hope you can work something out that works for you. PM me if you'd like to talk further.
