I feel exactly the same as you. I just get up and do it and count the hours until I can leave. I fight the urge to call in sick every. single. day. And I have a decent job - good boss, reasonable benefits, and time off, etc. I like the vast majority of my coworkers even. I've tried working in other jobs and still end up feeling the same. My feelings of depression about my job make no logical sense and that almost makes it worse. Why can't I be ok like everyone else? It helps me to keep going because my husband and I just bought a great place to live. We could squeak by on his salary but I couldn't live with myself if I did that to our financial situation and jeopardized our ability to comfortably pay our mortgage so I just keep going and being sad about it. Thanks for posting this - it helps hearing that others are struggling with the same feelings.
