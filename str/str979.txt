I try my best at everything but nothing good ever comes of it I make plans and every time they just crash and burn I look at people and wish I could be like them which leads to being jealous depressed and being filled with hatred I wish I had the strength to kill myself but I don't so I give up I'm just going to lie in bed and rot until somthing eventually pushes me over the edge and I do kill myself
