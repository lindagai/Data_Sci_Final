Hi r/MHS, I was wondering if anyone else here has dabbled in light therapy or other methods to get your circadian rhythms to be in line with your external obligations. My psychiatrist is a researcher in circadian rhythms and believes it can help (specifically depression, but anyone really) a lot.Your body undergoes all sorts of rhythmic fluctuations, and if your obligations force you to work contrary to those fluctuations, you will have a harder time feeling mentally 100%.Some stuff you can do:* Drug yourself into a good rhythm with caffeine and/or sleeping aids (melatonin is healthiest!). This path can be tricky but if you get your cycle on track it might be worth it.* Light therapy -- get a SAD lamp and/or dawn simulator to use in the A.M. to make up for being inside too much. Bright full-spectrum light is an important signal to your brain to *wake up!** "Dark therapy" -- Just as important as light in the morning is dark in the evening. Avoid backlit screens (and/or use f.lux/twilight/etc.) in the evening and keep your sleeping area dark. Which leads to...* Sleep hygiene -- your sleeping area should be used mostly for sleep (sex is ok), as dark and quiet as possible, and you should avoid doing anything in the hours before bed that could interfere with good sleep. Caffeine, drinking, smoking, and eating too late all qualify.Anyone else experimented with this at all? I'm eager to discuss it. I'm far from perfect at the above bullet points, but I have improved my sleep habits quite a bit to go from insomniac/night owl to just groggy in the mornings before work.
