I have devised a plan. I have one last cigarette it is a tailor made Dunhill blues the last cigarette in my Dunhill pack. I usually smoke Rollies so here is my grand plan the day that I will commit suicide is the day I smoke that Cigarette when I run out of rollies or I don't have enough money to buy another pack when I am forced to smoke that cigarette I will be staring her in the face with the second hand smoke lingering all around her and as I finish that cigarette I will finish my life.
