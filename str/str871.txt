It is my birthday in 4 hours, and the sounds of impending loneliness and paralysis haunt me as I study alone in this quiet corner of the universe.I helped the university clubs for 5 years and they literally abandoned me for no reason at all, having events and groups involving every single person except me, when I asked why, I was told I didn't try hard enough to contribute, that I had done absolutely nothing at all during the 5 years I was there.My other friends decided I was a rapist and physically assaulted me, deciding that they should beat and kill me, an hour later after doing so the person making the accusation apologized for lying.The only person who said he cared decided to be an utter cunt, he's an asshole, he tells me everything is my fault, he berates me for no reason, and he accuses everything I do out of spite or laziness. He also thinks anything I want to do is because I'm in love with everyone, which is utter bullshit.(An example of this is when I meant to return a book to my friend, it belonged to her fiance, but I'd heard things weren't great between them, so I asked said friend if it was safe to give it to them, he said it wasn't. I went home, and accidentally left it behind, he'd accused me of leaving it there to be someone else's problem)A friend I cared about dearly was very sexual to me and actually grinded against me in a club, the next day she got angry at me for trying to bring it up, claiming afterwards I'd "ruined her birthday" after 4 months of being told I shouldn't talk to her, I stopped caring. I just wanted my fucking friend back. I got called deluded and that I'd made it all up. 2 months later I thought I'd try and be friends again, she agreed and after multiple exams accidentally overslept. I was told that I didn't care about my friendships, that I was essentially a compulsive liar and likely inflicted with Borderline Personality disorder.And I'm just trying to find any reason at all to want to be alive and I can't find one and overall I just want to kill myself everyday. I am truly alone and have been given absolutely no rhyme or reason as to why and blamed for everything. No one will ever like me, no one ever has, and no one ever will.
