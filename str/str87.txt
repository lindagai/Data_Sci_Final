Your welcome. I love answering these posts, its always good to give advice to someone trying to support a depressed loved one. Actually, I recommend you read a short article I found months ago and still love. 10 things not to say to a depressed person and why. You know its the right article when its on a site called nocknock. (I think that's how its spelled.)
