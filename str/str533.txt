yeah I can't bring myself to open up to my closest friend.   I think he kinda knows how I feel because of the way  act but he can't really know unless I tell him.   I tried talking to my doctor but I had a hard time saying it.   he referred me to a psychologist who I also had trouble opening up to, eventually I stopped going because it all seemed so pointless.   I can't help wondering
