I live a life evolved around getting fucked up. In just graduated high school and I can confidently say I've been depressed for years. I'm scared that I have no potential in life, there is a lack of happiness is my life that pushes me to go forward. When one of my friends told me about his gun collection all I could think of was " is it finally going to happen" " I can actually kill myself now". For fucks sake, the moment I realize the possibility of having gun in my hand all I could think about was blowing my brains out to finally end this sad life. I feel like those who are depressed are the closest to living in "hell". I don't believe in God but I wake up everyday in this world thinking I'm in hell bc everyday I think about how much happiness is missing. I hate my family, I don't have any genuine friends. The fact that I'm 18 and my whole life is ahead of me. A sad painful life, I know of it. I'm going ask for the gun. Ropes always scared me I don't want to die in pain it'll just give me time to think about what I'm doing.
