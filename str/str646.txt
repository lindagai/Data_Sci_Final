I have been in a long distance relationship before. It can be difficult. If you love him and he loves you, you can make it work though. You just need to be patient and find ways to stay connected. For example, find a good TV show to watch 'together' on skype or FaceTime and continue texting/video chatting. You should also set up times to visit each other. My girlfriend and I were 8 hours apart and once a month we took turns seeing each other for a long weekend. Another option is to hang out with friends and vent with them about it to get your mind off of him for a bit. Things will get better over time. If things don't work out between you two there are so many other great guys out there. Just keep that in mind
