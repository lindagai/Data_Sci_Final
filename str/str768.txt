I am pretty drunk so this may not be me at my most eloquent, but here I go. when i was 15 my father killed himself. A few years after, I began what must have been a form of self harm. I damaged my anus over a period of time. If I sought medical attention at the very least I think they would say I would need a bag temporally if not permanent. I graduated university with a useless history degree (first class/high gpa as if that matters), and no work experience. I spent the best years if my life daydreaming, watching porn, and drinking alone. I also have severe perfectionism/neurosis and social anxiety. I am from northern ireland, a place with little opportunities for contextI am 22 with no friends,what I think is irreparable damage, no future, a humiliating past . I believe I will commit suicide by way of knife to the throat while drunk. I though i may as well share my story before I end it. i would do anything for a second chance.
