Oh god.  I just had my bridal shower today and nearly died because I had a panic attack and everyone just. kept. going. as if I was okay.  I felt awful.  No.  I FEEL awful.  I still feel awful.  How in the world am I going to even survive the wedding day itself?  There will be over 75 people there, and I can barely handle 10.  I'm sorry, I just needed to get that out.  My chest still hurts, I'm still burning up, I'm still drained.  Advice welcome as well, but I mainly just needed to vent it out.
