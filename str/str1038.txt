Its a long story about how this all happened but i *felt* a piece of myself die, it hurts so much but also, i feel just fine, but god im so lonely i feel myself waste away a bit a little everyday, i get caught up in fantasies in mind that i use to escape, and the more i do that, the more i believe it would just be easier to end it, im so fucking lonely it makes me hurt i just want to love someone, but theirs no one for me to love, i just feel empty and its killing me i have a trillion and half thoughts sprinting through my mind, all the details of the fantasies ive made are constanlty flying through my head, i remember them so vividly, more than i remember the real world, i just want someone to hold me so i can cry or i just want it go away
