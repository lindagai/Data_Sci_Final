I'm in the same hole man, although I've had slightly better luck scoring interviews.Worked in retail for a few months, and while it sucked, the only reason I quit was 'cause two of our four person department left, and finishing on time was literally impossible. Having every level of management breathing down your neck is straight out of office space.Maybe today I'll actually work on the one side project I got an idea for.
