I don't understand, i don't get it i just wanted to talk about anything but me, but i said i was suicidal, but so were you.I don't get it, i mean i do get it, it concerns people but i don't deserve help, i don't WANT help, i just wanted to have a conversation. And then someone else gets roped in, and i really appreciate the severity, and the kindness, but i just wanted to talk about something else, even if it was someone's problemsI just don't want to do anything anymore to be honest. I want to just slip into the long sleep and be fine with it.EDIT: I feel like I'm suicidal far too often and that it bothers others. Then they start trying to help me and it's like... no i don't deserve your kindness, your attention i just said i want to kill myself, why are you so concerned about me?
