HiI am 17 years old male and I'm in schoolI don't want to do this anymoreI wake up in the morning and come home from school wanting to die. Most nights I cry myself to sleep.My dream is to go into film directing one day but my parents see otherwise.I want to drop from Core Math to Math Lit(easier maths)[the system in south africa] but my dad says I'm not allowed to. He goes on and on but what is my \"plan\" not now but for the rest of my life and I don't answer. He goes on saying that it stresses him but its sounds like bullshit. Why would him and my mother care I have a younger sister. Can't they just forget me and just love her. She succeeds at her age far beyond I ever did and she will probably continue to succeed. I have tried killing myself 3 times already and I'm trying hard to steer away from a 4th. I have picked up vaping and been drinking excessively on weekends to try and forget about what I'm going through.I only have one real friend, but despite us being almost brothers he can't really relate what I'm going through. I don't know what to do.I went to a psychologist once and he said I was being immature so I walked out.Frankly I thinks its an outrage for a psychologist to say that to someone dealing with depression.I am on the verge of tears writing this and I am at my last resort. My parents don't understand and the only vice I can think of people that may know what I'm going through are the people on this sub reddit.And a cherry on this entire thing is that on my 18th birthday I have to go to a 5 day complusery math camp which all students have to do.Please help me.I can't do this anymore.Because frankly at the moment my 18th birthday present will be a noose around my neck and a trip with the Black Parade.
