I have the same problem. Every job I've had has been awful. I've had "good" jobs, but I'm not sure what's so good about them. Sitting at a desk, doing boring shit that I have no interest in, all while being watched like a hawk by a manager who doesn't even consider treating me like a human being. Every day just reinforces that you are LESS than they are because of the name of your position. And your reward for a week, a month, a year of working? Do it again. For 50 more years. With no real breaks. Maybe a week or two a year of you're exceptionally lucky. I don't know how anyone manages it. The requirement that I be a wage slave for the rest of my life is the #1 reason why I want to die. And everyone around me just marches through life with no problem. Work every day, come home smiling, somehow feeling like the hour or two a day you have to yourself is enough (after spending 10+ hours on working) and then life is good.  How??? How the fuck is this real? It's a fucking nightmare that almost no one seems to realize they're in.
