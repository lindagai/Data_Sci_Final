I can definitely relate. I was just recently thinking about how almost bizarre &amp; movie like my last long episode of depression was. I am embarrassed about how I acted for a good 4-6 months. And being \"better\" &amp; doing well I thought I was showing everyone how that's not me but in my head if I have free time I say the meanest things ever about myself.  If anything outside my head goes wrong I crack &amp; am slowly becoming that person I thought I wasn't all over again.
