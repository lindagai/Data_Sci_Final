I do this too! Just walk and walk until my feet get tired and sometimes stop to go into some stores to browse. Maybe try on some ugly shoes, skim through books, sniff scented candles and silly stuff like that... It really is fun, especially when the weather is nice and you have a good playlist to listen to.
