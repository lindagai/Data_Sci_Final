I honestly don't think I've yet to feel actual love. It just seems as though nobody was ever interested in me in any way other than needing my help in any kind of work or just as someone to invite to get another person to pay for the drinks.I don't think I even felt love to someone, not even sure if I did for my own family. I do care about them but at some times it's more of a cultural things more than actual caring, kind of like a "oh, in this situation most people would try and consult their family" or "here most people will try and call their family to see if they're safe". It's hard for me to actually form a bond with someone, even friends who I regularly talk to and hang out with just seem to have an "ya he's there" aura around them. I know they want to hang out with me but I actually feel 0 need to try and engage in any form of contact with them.I'm 22 and can't function in social events if they don't involve alcohol, have constant suicidal thoughts, it's already clear to me I'll commit suicide, I just don't know when.I just once want to feel truly loved. I don't know how that feels from my family even though I know they do love me, but there's this feeling for me that I have failed as a person for being able to actually form this kind of connection with another person who's not biologically inclined to love me. At some point I remember glimpses of those kind of feelings starting to emerge but they disappeared very fast, as I didn't want to get burnt.I honestly don't know why I'm writing this, but it helps even if no one reads this. I just don't want to do this anymore, I'm too tired...
