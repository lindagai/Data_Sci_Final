I have a friend who constantly tries to show his superiority over me by pointing out all my flaws. Always trying to make me seem stupid in front of everyone I meet. I wish I could get him out of my life but he's a part of my closely knit group of friends. Everytime I'm with him all I can think about is how badly I want to kill myself. Do other people in this subreddit have this person?
