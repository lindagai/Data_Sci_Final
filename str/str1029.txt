Hey so I don't know if I have depression but I just found this subreddit and thought maybe I could just say some things to the void of the Internet.So I'm 21-F about to graduate college in a year and recently my suicidal thoughts have become more intrusive and steady. This is not the first time. Three years ago I was sexually assaulted by two people I had trusted. This led me to a life of hyper sexuality (although I've stopped that for now) and self-loathing. Either way, I find myself staring at my closet and imaging a noose hanging there so I can kill myself. It happens every day. I haven't told anyone irl about it because I don't want people to worry about me i guess (??) I just really hate being alive right now and I don't feel like I have a logical reason toIdk what I'm asking for but Tl;dr: I'm not diagnosed with anything but I feel super suicidal please listen/talk to me/ etc.
