I'm 25 but living at home due to student debtI feel particularly suicidal right now.... but here's the thing: parents have NO idea that I've been severely depressed for the past 3 days.They don't even know that I have bipolar disorder (because they don't believe it's a real illness, and I really can't be bothered to convince them it is).How do I tell my parents that I'm suicidal? (I want to know the best way to do this.) I know I should go to inpatient, but they at least need to know that I'm depressed. Otherwise, they're not going to know why I'm going to the hospital and it'll freak them out.I don't want to just tell them "hey mom I'm depressed"FYI, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 22 while I was in college, and I moved back home at 24... which is why they don't know about any of my history of depression.
