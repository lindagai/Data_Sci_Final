You know getting yelled at isn't the best of things to start off. Having my mom calling me stupid sometimes and not having any common sense. Hell she once said "You have no friends" and that still stays with me to this day. I apparently don't have any common sense as my mom says and i only think about myself even though I enjoy listening to people and want to give them advice and even want to help them out anyway i can. My mom is a big part of me always being depress. She would say i never have common sense when i do something dumb and whenever i try and help i would always forget something or just do it wrong. IT'S NOT MY FUCKING FAULT PEOPLE FORGET. It pisses/makes me sad how many times i would get yelled at and get told "Use your common sense!" or "Think before you actually do it!" and i try i actually really do. But sometimes i feel like me trying isn't good enough at all. All i want to do is play video games, watch anime and talk to friends. Instead she wants me to go to college saying that i wont survive in the real world without going to college. Yeah she makes a good point but she forcing me into it when lets all be honest. College isn't for everybody and not everybody can even go in the first place. I've been talking (typing) for a while now and i don't even think i stayed on topic. I want to kill myself sometimes. I feel like that would be nice for me.. Forgetting about working, people, and family. They are all a pain. Growing up sucks. Sure people would miss me (sarcasm, people would but they would get over it) but sometimes people cant deal with everything. If in the future it was getting hard and i had a choice to a point where i couldn't handle it. I'll take the easy way out..
