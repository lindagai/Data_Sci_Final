I lost my mother a year ago , I stopped smoking weed (supposedly that was gonna help me) got a job ..and I still feel like blowing my brains out ..my dad ...he loves me but his attitude is buck up and do what you gotta do type ..and him and my stepmom and my sister are all alcoholics that's there fallback ...fuck I just am fucking over the idea that you just keep your nose down and your problems go away. ..like it's so simple ...fuck .
