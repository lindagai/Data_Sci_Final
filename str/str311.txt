I also felt pretty happy when i helped other people or connected to them, sadly i don't have the possibilities to do that near me (No old peoples centers or homeless centers around). Sure it works for some and for some it doesn't, i enjoy the company of the elderly because it's easy to connect to them and they usually tend to be very open because they don't have anything to lose anymore and thus do not have to alter themselves to \"fit in\
