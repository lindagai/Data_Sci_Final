After years of being mentally depressed while pursuing a career (software development), I'm about to leave everything behind and dive into something much more trivial like stocking on a market. I'll probably get 1/4 of what I do currently but at least I have a chance to rescue myself.And yes, I was in your position before. When she starts dating someone you will be destroyed. Pray it is not someone from your work.
