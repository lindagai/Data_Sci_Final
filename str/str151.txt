There is this kid in my class who is extremely depressed. He talks about it all the time, about how he wants to hurt himself, about how useless he is, how he just wants it all to end.  I feel for him however he is a complete ass to everyone around him except for a few people, and i dont approve of this.  (He might just be lashing out at them because he feels misunderstood) Many people snicker at him behind his back because he is socially awkward, and many of my friends diss him too . i dont think he is a bad person and i want to be supportive. What do i do?
