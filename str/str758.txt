Hi, I guess I'll start with I'm currently in the military not in it for long though, still in ait. I've never been this sad and had so much anxiety till I got to this company. I've talked to someone at the clinic before and she just diagnosed me with envionmental depression whatever that means to them. I think it started off with me getting injured and they didn't believe me, I got treated like a liar even though my fracture was coming out in various test and it just got so bad that I ended up with another injury but they just brushed me off to physical thearapy. So now here I am injured and I can't talk to the sergeants here because they can't give a crap about anyone here. I've got an opiate as a pain medicine and many times thoughout the day I contemplate on over dosing on it.. I've talked to my family before about this and they're doing their best to be there for me but there's only so much I could take. I've been getting anxiety attacks quite frequently and I just start peeling my skin off my fingers till I start bleeding which weirdly calms me down. I really just want to end it all I'm so tired of everything. I don't know what else to do I feel like no body cares about me.
