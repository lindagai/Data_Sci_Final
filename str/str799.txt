I am 21 years old. For about 6 or 7 years now, I've been depressed. Duo cal thoughts have only come into play within the last two years. I'm alive, I'm okay -- however, in times of deep stress or emotional pain I feel overwhelmed. When that happens my mind drifts into self-harm related thoughts. Sometimes I just feel like I'm being burned alive, or imagine it at least. Months pass and sometimes, now, I imagine shooting myself in the side of the head. This is a regular thingThese thoughts give me a temporary sense of relief. In fact, thinking about it makes me feel a little bit better. I don't actually want to kill myself nor have made any plans or have intentions of killing myself.I am just wondering if you guys have had any of the same experiences as me -- not mention I deal with sleep paralysis on a regular basis.I do not fear death anymore, but fear I will be suicidal someday. Again, not urgent, this is a very casual post. Should I be worried about thoughts like this?
