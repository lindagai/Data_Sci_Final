Some strategies I use:Listening to music.Listening to audiobooks/netflix when I don't need to focus (project planning and easy work).Coffee. Love that stuff so much.Setting an alarm to walk around and stretch out my back once per hour.Promising myself to smile and say hi to one person by name every day. It always makes me feel better even though I almost never want to do it.I put all of my tasks in a checklist and check them off so I feel good about finishing them.When none of those work, I fall back on the fact that I avoid mascara and I go cry in a bathroom where I know no one from my company will hear me.
