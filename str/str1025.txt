Living in a house where my parents are constantly fighting. Having an older brother that sexually molested me as a young teen that I can't feel anything but hatred towards. Having ruined the perfect friendship I had with a girl that I was close to becoming her boyfriend. Doing terribly in university because I'm always feeling down. Why am I always feeling down? Because I'm stuck in this fucking loop of nothing but regrets and sadness.I can't leave the house because I have no where to go to. I can't stay in the house it's fucking depressing and I have nothing to do. I just want to die. I really don't care anymore. I hate living in this place. I wish I was born somewhere else.
