Being too scared "keeps" me alive. However inviting death is, it's not something I can do. I just can't. I also know I'd make people sad if I did kill myself. I guess I don't want them to feel the same way I do. I don't want anyone to die because of me, and as much as I don't really care, it's not something that I can just accept. Especially my family, I hate them, but they're still family...
