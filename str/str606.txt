I'm so sorry you're feeling like that:*( I'm going through something today too.  So tough. I have both anxiety and depression and it's hard! Very hard.  For me, what I do is I hide out in my bedroom, on my bed, just burrowed under covers and watch tv on my laptop. I don't reach out to friends, have no social interest, don't want to shower or take care of myself, just get numb and stay numb and watch something diverting on the computer.
