My life has been perhaps the biggest waste of one since it started; I am not a productive member of society, I do not talk to people, and I am, no matter how deep you dig, a cynical, narcissistic, nihilistic bitter old person who will die alone. I have existential crises on an hourly basis and every single one of my thoughts involves death, suicide or depression in one way or another. Anti-Depressants will not help me, only the fact that I know I will die does.
