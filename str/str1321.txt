I know how you feel. I want to kill myself, i failed a lot of my life, don't really see a point in it anymore. People don't understand. They don't believe me when i say "i want to kill myself". To be honest though, i might as well live this crappy excuse for a life while i still can. I don't have the strength to die. I feel like i just observe life now, not actually live it. All this crap passes like a blur to me.
