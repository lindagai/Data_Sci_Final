I can't live like this anymore. I try to help myself but it always backfires. I take my biggest leaps to just be pushed back. I can't even get a text back from people. I've lost all the people I care about because of my depression. I can't think of a single person who cares about me. I know I'm better off dead and that's all I think about. No one would have to deal with my drama or ever have to listen to me again. No more asking people to hangout or do something fun, I know that annoyed everyone anyway. I've always thought about suicide, but I can't stop thinking about DOING it, now. I hate my life just as much as everyone else does.
