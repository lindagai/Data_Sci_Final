It's been too long /r/depression I haven't commented or posted in forever. I feel like I need to make a difference. My mom always asks me why I wear my hood. It's just more safe under it, summer is here, and I can't wear it as much. [Here is a picture of me and my hoodie.](http://imgur.com/36molNR)I Just want to try and make a difference, there's so many people who are submitting seeking help with their own form of depression, and there's not enough people helping.I'll be here for the next few hours at least. Depression can go fuck itself for me tonight. Hope I can at least help 1 person.
