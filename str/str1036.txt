I can't do this anymore. I can't wake up and struggle to get out of bed because I was waking up and ruminating on how awful I feel all throughout the night, and because the first thought upon waking is "I should kill myself today." I can't go to work and listen to everyone talk about what they did over the weekend and the dates they went on and the friends they hung out with while I sat at home, sobbing and watching Netflix by myself.I can't stand the thought of starting school again to get away from this job I hate, I can't shake the feeling that I'll fuck it up and fail out again. I can't imagine having the motivation to study and go to class.I can't take being so exhausted all the time. I can't bring myself to exercise or cook or do anything that might help me feel better.I can't take not having interests anymore. Nothing is fun. Nothing is enjoyable. Nothing makes me happy.I'm alone, I'm in mental and physical pain, and I can't do it anymore. What's the point of this shit? No, I can't make it better, I can't pull myself out of it, and neither can medication or therapy apparently. I just want this to be over.
