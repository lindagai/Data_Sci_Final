kinda of a long story because i gotta get it all out there, and i am in no way a an even half decent writer so bare with meso basically, the start of sophmore year last year, there was this girl in my computer class that would sit with me and my nerdy friends, she was a quiet short freshmen that did her own thing, we became friends after a little while because of our interest in stupid facebook memes and other stuff like that and she would always vent to me and i guess i was always her friend and boy do i tell ya, i fucking loved her with all my being, and all my friends wanted me to ask her out but i was waiting for her birthday in mayfast forward to april 8th it was after school and i was playing minecraft with my brother as usual, then my best friend sent me a pic of her with my now not really good friend in a hotel bed because they all got a room at a hotel and he said they were gonna do sex stuff and i fucking lost it, i told my friend i was going to kill myself because it fucking hurt so much and i couldn't control my rage, he showed her because he was with him and she called me and told me she liked me this whole time and she stopped with the sex stuff with him (btw him will be the dude she was doing stuff with) this started the happiest time of my life, me and this girl did everything together, dates, falling asleep skyping, the whole shabang and it was the happiest i've ever been, i went 16 years of my life lonely and nothing to look forward to, every day i woke up at 4:30, hour before i usually woke up and stood at my bus stop 20 minutes early just so i wouldn't miss seeing her that daythis happiness lasted 3 weeksweek 1: we were dealing with the whiplash of my group of friends pissed at her that she didn't go through that shit with my friend and i turned away so many of my friends for her, because she was all i needed, as stupid as that sounds. she would actively avoid him and so did i, and i made sure no harm came her way. this week i was still adjusting to happiness and we hungout every second we could, skipped classes, i skipped work to go see a movie with her, i ignored friends ect.week 2: i became more comfortable and we started kissing, grinding, and other generic teenage physical stuff i wont go into too deep of detail, but that was an almost daily occurence, and the weekend of that week i did something i never did before, i snuck out without my VERY over protective mother knowing, and boy i tell you, my mother was extremely over protective, not letting me do anything outside of school if it wasnt convenient for her, anyhow i snuck out that friday and saturday, hungout with her friend, may of done more physical stuff, had fun ect.begins last week lads oh boyweek 3: by now my friends pretty much are very pissed off with me, everyones angry but idc, i love this girl and she loves me (least lord do i hope) anyhow, my mom finds out about me skipping classes and flips her shit (shes very scary when shes angry i tell ya what) and i get in trouble, the schools administration warns me not to do it again (i do it anyway lol, i dont care, im a happy man and i do stupid things when im happy) anyhow, her birthday was the 3rd of may and the weekend before it, we made plans to have actual sex that friday, after my mother went on a overnight date and would be gone all night, after she left the love of my life (so far? dunno) gets dropped off at my place and we make the 1 hour and fifteen minute trek to the local walmart where i spent most of my money on food, condoms, plan B and stuff like that and we do the do at my place and fall asleep cuddling til her parents pick her up from my house. that saturday my mother was going over to her boyfriends for the night and taking my siblings with her so i would be home alone again and that night after my mother left, i walked across town in my soaked boat shoes and wool socks and cuddled with her at her house and watched tv til her parents made me leave and i walked home at 3 am through the dangerous part of town alone, nearly died. (where shit hits the fan) that sunday was the dude that started this whole things bday and she asked me if she could hangout with him because she cared about him as a friend still, with his family for his birthday party and i trusted her so i was cool with it, it only lasted 5 hours and when she got home, she was crying telling me that i would want her dead and i was extremely confused and i assumed he tried something or something i guess and she didn't tell me what was wrong and told me she would tell me in the morning at school, by then i was super confused and even i didn't expect it. i was up the whole night.may 2nd: the day the sun was stolen from my skyshe broke up with me that morning, (during it she had the guy whose bday she went to the day before hiding in a stairwell above ours listening which made me feel so betrayed) and i dont remember much, but i know I cut a huge gash in my leg and threw myself down some stairs, i hurt so unbelievably bad that i didn't feel falling down a flight of stairs, bleeding in one of my highschools stairwells and i haven't felt much since but sadnesssince then she started dating that guy, who doesn't let her come anywhere near me, he goes through her phone, forces her to block me on facebook and skype (we still talk through snapchat tho) and when she brings me around with him, he gets super jealous and gets mad at her because im around, 2 weeks after that i went shopping with them (she invited me first) and when me and her were walking together he would walk behind us, or we would sit down he'd stand somewhere away from us pouting and being whiny, and after shopping we dropped him off at his house because he had work and we hung out after that and he got mad when he found out we went out to dinner and i spent the night at her place when we watched doctor who together during all of the drama, everyone told me she was garbage and to not even waste my time with her, even when we were dating, but i saw through that and i loved her, i loved her with all my being, i risked my life, socially, economically (no one ever spent money on her, so i spent every cent i earned on her) and ultimately physically because a month and a half later, my heart yearns for her, i love this girl so much, she was the spark i needed to save me from the crippling depression i was enduring before we started dating, and she left me for someone that yells at her for things out of her control, goes through her phone, doesn't let her hangout with anyone but him, lies to her, ect and it fucking kills me because she acts like i did that stuff when i put her before everything and i dont know. still, 6ish weeks later i still want to die as much as i did when she broke up with me, i have nothing to look forward to and the loneliness over summer break doesnt help since i ruined all but a few friendships.so /r/depression, any advice? and i know this wasnt the most clear, im tired and caffeinated out of my mind and ill clear anything need up, i just dont know what to do
