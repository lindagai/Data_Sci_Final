In 2009 I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease: an inflammatory bowel condition chronic and uncurable.. Incurable?... Anyway, it is mostly in remission, flares happening occasionally due to allergies and the like. But this is thanks to regular Humira self-injections and many other meds. Idk if it is the pain relocating itself from my bowels to my head but I really dont feel like living anymore. I just quit a shitty job of 2 years in hospitality, and everyday I want to run away from everything that's not my family and my dog. Im taking a tiny amount of online schooling but it can get pricey if I want to continue. Im very weak from years of that ravaging illness so I wouldnt be any good in manual labor or military work etc. I love the outdoors and if I didnt need REALLY expensive meds I would run into the woods like that one guy from that one movie.. Into the Wild? idk, too lazy and tired to google. I want to run but I cant, every one and thing around me says I need a job or something else going for me to be of any worth.. I just want to take care of my dog, grow food and have it all leave my head but it wont because I cannot escape and if I dont get away soon Im afraid for my own safety. I have no money, everything Ive saved up to quit that fuckin job is spent. And what the hell am I supposed to do when I turn 25 or whatever and this fucking US government says I CANT HAVE INSURANCE ANYMORE. I dont qualify for unemployment because I quit at like 21 months or something. Idk what to do, evolutionarily I should be dead but here I fucking am.. complaining about life on the internet.
