I got sent to jail for several months from 2014 to late 2015 and after I had settled in to the reality of being incarcerated I was in the best mental state I've been in for years. I was full of optimism and hope for the future, having everything taken away from me made me appreciate everything so much more from the inside. But now I'm out here again and I don't appreciate anything, nothing makes me genuinely happy, I'm moving nowhere in life and I can't even convince myself to do anything about it. I tried enrolling in college and ended up wasting several thousand dollars of my parents money because I just wouldn't go. My grandfather got me a very good job when I got out and I'm on the verge of losing it right now because I can't get out of bed in the morning. I haven't made a single friend since I got out and those that I had mostly forgot about me or don't want to be around me now. In jail I was able to make friends very quickly, I had a personality and wasn't socially anxious or depressed. I don't know what the fuck to do with myself, I can't live up to anyone's standards including my own, I'm a burden on my family, I have no friends, no support system,  I go to therapy weekly but my therapist has admitted after 6 months of seeing her she doesn't feel like she's helping me at all. What the fuck.. I don't fucking get it. I could opt to go to prison right now but I know that's far from productive but I can't keep going on the way I am. I'm only 20 years old and don't want to miss this part of my life but at the same time what am I missing? It could get better but after 10 months it's been nothing but a steady decline. It's fucked how when you're in jail all you can think about is how great your life going to be upon release, then you get out and you realize you're in the same spot you were before and now the cards are stacked against you.
