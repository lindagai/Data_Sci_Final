Everyone has their own life force that is sapped through negativity and bad recurring thoughts. Believe me, I've been there. I've thought dark things. I'm here to try and listen to people now. What's your story?I assume you're a man. You need to seek out your own tribe. Rootlessness and despair is endemic in the modern age and you are not, nor will you ever be, alone in the suffering. You must reach out. You have to make the radical choice towards complete self ownership and get rid of the toxic people in your life dragging you down. You must overcome your own shame and own your life.Reach out in a deep and profound way to anybody here or in your real life and try to obtain actionable advice that will treat your issues in your headspace. Depression is a chemical change in the brain but pills simply numb the mind, they do not and never will truly address the source. My inbox is always open and I don't judge.
