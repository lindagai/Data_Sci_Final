I know the feeling. The fact is a lot of people don't understand depression and don't know how to react when you tell them you are depressed.I can give you a few tips based on some of the stuff you mentioned. I don't have tips for everything, because I struggle myself with things like making friends. As far as exercise goes, go on youtube and search \"low impact cardio for beginners.\" I found that a good place to start with exercise. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50kH47ZztHs) is one of the videos I've been exercising to. There are lots of others though. If you can't make it through the entire 30 min that's okay, at least you did some exercise. Try to go longer each day until you can get through the entire thing without problems, then find a new video to follow.Tips to study better depend entirely on the individual. Maybe you do best in complete silence, maybe you need music, maybe you need to sit in a coffee shop with lots of people around. Only you know what situation you can concentrate in best, figure out what that is and put yourself in that environment when it's time to study.That's all I've got for now, but if you want tips on anything specific let me know and I'll help if I can.
