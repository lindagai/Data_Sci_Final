From a secular point of view, what's the point of living at all if it all comes to an end? The only thing in this world that is consistent is change. This is good and bad cause destruction bring creation, and creation brings destruction. As it has always been, and continue to be. Alternate Persuasion: The ever existing (orderly) Chaos and inevitable annihilation of everything makes living seem pointless from a worldly point of view. Sure it's fun for now, but what happens when it's all over? Do you forget it all? Currently, things that are lost, are lost for good in this world. And with heat death being a very likely possibility, all will be wiped away for a good while. And what comes from the ashes will never be the same, at least, as far as we might remember? Note: I am in no means suicidal, just questioning it out of misery.
