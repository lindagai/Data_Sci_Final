I’m a 16 year old girl from Brazil, currently in the middle of my Junior year. I like biology, especially evolutionary and behavior studies, and recently I’ve spent a long time reading about certain genes and emailing PhDs. I have always liked philosophy and theology, and engaged in the Internet with people with the same passions. Some of them were impressed with my intelligence and suggested me to take Mensa test. My dream is to study biology in the United States. Seriously, I just HATE this country. The government, the people, the territory, it all has always disgusted me. Universities here are far from being like American ones. They’re not nearly as concerned with things that matter such as research, they’re more concerned about how many black people they have on campus. I’m not black, so I’m quite disadvantaged here.  HOWEVER. I am pretty sure I am the worst student at my school, or close to that. In my first two High School years, I barely passed—I don’t know what my grade would be in GPA, but you need an average of 6 out of 10 to pass on my school, and mine was around 7. Then, in the first semester of this year, I fell in deep depression for the third or fourth time in my life, and my grades plummeted to nearly zero. Meanwhile, my friends are getting 9's and 10's. I attribute all of that to mental problems, both my off and on depression and possibly something else affecting my focus and motivation. I am certainly not adept to reach my dream therefore. So I asked myself, what AM I capable of achieving? My grades are no higher than in the 10th percentile. My attractiveness is in the 30th percentile (it’s a long story, how I calculated that one). I am socially awkward, borderline autistic, and have few friends, nearly all from the Internet. What will my future be like? It seems to me likely that I'll live with my parents and grow into a spinster, but it’s obvious that I don’t want that. I wish I could kill myself, but I don't have the ability to do that either.
