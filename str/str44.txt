I just can't be bothered anymore I feel like this is a drag and no matter what I try or how much effort I put into something it always yields no results.. I'm just so very tired of everything and really really don't want to imagine what pain my future holds for me I'm only 18 and I'm going to uni soon.. Maybe if I can hold on till then than things will get better, or they won't who cares anymore the only reason I'm typing this is so I have an outlet since I don't have anyone to talk to
