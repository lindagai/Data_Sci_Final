I've been battling depression and PTSD for over four years now. I was hospitalized due to a very bad episode of pancreatitis which left me in the ICU for 4 weeks and in the heart hospital for 3 months back in 2012. I can't keep living with these memories. I've tried seeing a therapist, I've tried finding different outlets to feel better. Nothing I have tried has worked. I'm confident I'm an undesirable person. Every relationship I've had has crumbled due to my PTSD. Lately I've been thinking of different ways to just off myself. I'd just like to take some pills and just pass away in my sleep. I'm a big disappointment to my family, they won't say it but I know I am. If I were to just leave this world, everybody would be much happier. Including myself.
