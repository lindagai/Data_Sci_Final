I've never had a job, fully. I want to concentrate on getting my life to where it needs to be, but I keep on fixating on the "it shouldnt/should be like this" thoughts. I wish my family understood how important and successful my streams have been, but I am not trying to put all of my eggs in one basket. I'm trying, but I'm actually quite scared.
