I've been free of self harm for about 2 months and I just couldnt do it anymore. I wanted to tell someone, or even just talk to someone in general, but I only have 3 friends, one who suffers from worse mental health problems than I do, one who just straight up doesn't like me, and one who called the police to my house after I made the mistake of telling her I was thinking about suicide, which wound me up in a mental hospital which pretty much just made everything worse. So I guess this is my confession or something.
