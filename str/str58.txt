I deal with depression everyday.  today I lost a dear friend to cancer.  He was there for me when I needed to talk, he gave us food when I was out of work and penniless and trying to feed a daughter.  A friend who loved my kids as grand-kids. Today I deal with loss of a man who I could count on to tell me that it was worth living and make me believe it.
