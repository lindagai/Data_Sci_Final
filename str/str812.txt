I've finally sought professional help for my lifelong depression  (I'm 30). I have been prescribed Lexapro and decided to look up side effects of antidepressants as this is my first time taking them.Long story short the sexual side effects are a big red flag. Sex is one of the few things that authentically make me happy (they were my natural antidepressant until my boyfriend dumped me). I know I'll always be sad but I really couldn't live without sex (I need it at least twice a week). If anything going without sex for a month after getting dumped exacerbated my depression more than anything.I've been avoiding tinder because I know a slew of one night stands and crappy fwbs is not good for my mental health in the long run, although as a semi attractive female I could get laid tonight if I really wanted to. But this depression (and the daily bouts of crying for no reason, perpetual self hatred, unable to function in normal life activities, etc) is no fun either. At the same time I'd rather be "sad" and enjoy sex than "normalized" with a low libido.I appreciate your thoughts.  This is my first post here so bear with me, please!
