      Every day for the last 15 years.  I'll often catch myself thinking, "I should die."  These days I no longer have any motivations to actually follow through with these thoughts; instead, I simply apologize to everyone, for everything.  Every time I apologize, I really mean to say, "I'm sorry for existing, I'm in the way."  At nearly 31 I no longer have aspirations to "move out," but rather to just "get out of the way."  That way the ones I love can go about their lives without having to look at me and remind me I'm a failure.  Every once in a while I'll come home and apologize to my mother.  I never say why.  It's often difficult to talk with family about these things.  I feel like talking about depression with my family would be like telling them they did horribly in raising me, so I bottle it up.  Don't do this.  It never ends well.  Get the feelings out--find a medium that allows you to do it.  Exercise, art, singing, dance, sports, something.
