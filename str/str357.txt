Looking for people experienced at \"faking it\" and carrying on. My emotions are taking too much of a toll on my life, disrupting everything from friends to school and I need to know how I can try to control them. When I am depressed I am paralyzed, unable to do anything, no motivation. Leads to anger where I just think about breaking something, fighting someone. Yeah I'm a teenager but this is something that I need to deal with now instead of waiting for it to pass.
