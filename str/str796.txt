Does anyone else miss being hospitalized?I sure do. I was outpatient for several months and seemed to make great improvements. But when I was discharged, I almost immediately relapsed. Back to outpatient, but this time it did not feel very useful. A couple inpatient stays (a day or two) at the same hospital. Then once they promised me a bed if I admitted to the ER I was suicidal, so I did. Surprise, no beds available so they sent me away to a psych hospital 3+ hours away. I was terrified, and it was the weekend so I had no way out for almost 3 days until I could get someone to release me against medical advice.Those three days I miss dearly. I guess maybe I'm romanticizing it because it was such a short stay, but i want to go back.I miss the structure, the security, being free of outside responsibilities. I miss being "stuck" with a group of people, as I tend to isolate myself. I miss being given sleeping pills whenever I wanted them and being able to sleep all the time. I miss the activities and the super nice "gym teacher" type guy. I miss being cared for.My meds have seemingly stopped working lately. I thought I had convinced myself to never do stupid things again, but I keep having this fantasy. I have a three day weekend from work coming up, and part of me wants to do something that will land me back in the hospital.But realistically, I can't. It would destroy my fiance and I financially. I could get 50% pay on medical leave, but that won't be enough. We'd lose the house, the car, everything.... but part of me doesn't even care anymore
