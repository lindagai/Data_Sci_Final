There are 3 ways how I Deal with them.SH wich is obv the worst way bcuz you might just go through with it...I Force my self to cry. I'm can't rly e in any way. It doesn't matter what happens i just don't start to cry... i just breakdown. But if I watch real life Hero Videos or read with emotion filld Storys i just Start to cry. I can't cry for my self only for others...My third way is to write. It may be about reasons or how I want to kill my self. It includes why this Form, how it works, why not the other Form and so on. I also got dozens of "letters" where I try to reason why I just killd myself... ( sometimes I don't write it down but just discuss it within me how and why)
