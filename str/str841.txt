This year, I've been recovering from a very bad and life changing depression crisis. The recovery is taking longer than I hoped and I think not having a supportive family nor friends has it's blame. It also upsets me that people don't take my condition serious, I tried to kill myself, I'm full of visible scars and that is still not enough for people to care. I don't want pity, just would like some love and care, it was the life long lack of it that got me in my state and I stupidly hope it will be what will get me out of it, but I just seem to be unlovable.        I gave up on trying to make friends or having a social life. I know people tend to dislike me and I don't blame them, I'm needy and I over-care. I always make sure people are alright and I suppose I can come across as condescending when trying to help them, so they see me as a counselor and not as a friend. So I started focusing on my skills and my studies. But I've been finding it very difficult to improve my skills as I get demotivated quickly since my thoughts immediately shift onto how much better everyone is, how the teachers hate me (which is irrational as I know they don't), how everyone else would laugh at my attempts and how I'm just this failure of a person, I believe that if I had the energy or motivation to improve, I would get some sense of pride and achievement and that should improve my mood and confidence.        I hate the place where I work but I need the money urgently so I manage through, but yesterday was without a doubt the worst day I've had so far, it seemed like my co-workers were too busy indulging themselves on this new coffee machine that arrived and I was left alone to serve a couple angry dozen customers all by myself.          My mood has been getting worse for a couple weeks now, but the stress at work yesterday and something else that happen was just too much, so I restarted self-harming, I stopped on the 1st of March and now besides it all I feel so disappointed and ashamed of myself whilst also feeling as I deserve all the physical pain in the world. I really don't see a point in recovery anymore. It feels like there's no place in the world for me and there won't be one, just as there is no one in the world for me and there won't be. I've came to the point of searching for funeral costs and the forms one needs to get to register a 'non-natural causes' death so in case it gets much worse or unbearable to the point of suicide, I'll take care of all the bureaucracy and fees so my mum doesn't have to deal with it. It's just a sense of security to have that back up plan, I won't do it.        I used to go to my uni's counselor but university has finished for the Summer so I have no access to it, I can't afford medication nor consultations. Sorry for the big post, just thought I'd explain my situation before asking for advice. I really want to improve myself and my skills, so I just wanted to know how do you guys cope with feeling lonely and demotivated?**tl;dr:** My depression is coming back and I want to know how to work with it so I can live my life and improve myself.
