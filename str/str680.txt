It's only tl;dr - you'll see later why.I wasn't born in aristocratic family. Not even in rich family. Not even in average but with parents that have some passion. My parents never thought me anything, didn't  show me funny or interesting things. I wish I were sent to piano lessons or to language school. I would like to be smart and popular.It's now impossible (my twenties) for me to be an ubermensch due to my uncommunicativness and lack of will to ~~do anything~~ live. I know that I have no chance with those, who were raised in superior way. I'm average. Or even less than that. I hate it, I would rather be nobody than average. I'm gonna Catch the... Bike and go wandering through the world.I think a few people will understand me becouse it's incorrect to wish to be better (financially and socially) than others.
