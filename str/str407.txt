Something I found great comfort in is the theory of absurdism. It basically posits that life is inherently meaningless, and it is impossible to find any meaning. My takeaway from it is that there isn't really a purpose or \"point\" to life, and we should just live it rather than try to figure that out. Maybe I'm the only one that finds comfort in it. I guess some sick, twisted part of me has never really considered suicide a viable option because I want to see how this crazy, nonsensical experience will all play out.
