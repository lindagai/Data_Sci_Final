My birthday is a few months from now and I am dreading its arrival. I see It only as a day to count the number of years since I stopped living. I do enjoy having the whole day to sleep. I hope you have a great birthday. Here's a virtual cake from me.  If the day goes to hell at least you can sleep until its over.
