I (24/M) have been severely depressed for much of my year long relationship with my (24/f) girlfriend.I live with her. I think me being depressed has finally broken her. My constant promises to get better and failing to do so. The endless ruined days, weekends.The last 2 days she had been distant and now today she has told me not to contact her. I think im gonna get home from work to find a break up letter.How do i save my relationshipI cant lose her
