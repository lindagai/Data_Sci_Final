I've been trying to get over her for the past 6 months, but it hasn't been working. I've been taking a few summer classes at college (i just graduated high school) and I feel like dropping myself in new surroundings still hasn't been helping much. We both feel like distance between us will be healthy, but it just sucks. How do i get over her? My friendship with her is so counterproductive because she talks to me about my emotions, but it still hurts to know that she doesn't feel the same way about me.
