tl: dr: Just want to know if anyone has had experience with telling their doctor they feel suicidal, and what kind of help resulted. I have to see mine (primary doctor, not a mental health specialist or anything) next week and tell her that once again the medication isn't working. I've said before that I think about dying/killing myself a lot but I think maybe I haven't used the right wording to be taken seriously. Do I have to say that I have a plan? I don't know exactly what result I want, except maybe a chance for my diagnosis to be reevaluated, for a different or more aggressive form or treatment. And a part of me wants to be sent the hospital for a week to be left alone. Anyway the first sentence is what I really want to know. I'm not calling a hotline because I hate hate hate telephones - mainly because I have a hearing problem and I do much better face to face so I can read lips.
