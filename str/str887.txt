But barely have the strength to do so. I dont want to feel pain. And I want it to be really successful bc I know that if it wouldnt be, people around me will judge me (or pity me). I hust want to end it all. I dont see anything that would cheer me up. Everyday feels like a new hell that I'd go through. Am I the only one feeling this way? PS: There's this one person that always cheered me up but she's now tired of me. ðŸ˜”
