Alone in my thoughtsHere I am all alone where I usually am,The thoughts keep coming like you can't understand.The pain is so real, it never goes away...I try and disguise it but I feel it everyday.What do I do to make this go away.It's endless the type to make you die inside...The kind that makes you question whether you want to be alive.What's the point of living anyways....With no one there to tell you it will be okay.One day I pray,That this will go away,And I can find happiness and just float away..
