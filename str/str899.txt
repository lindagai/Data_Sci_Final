I don't have any future or path that i'm following.I don't have any dreams or aspirations anymore.I dont have any feelings or care left about anything.I don't have anyone who takes me or my depression seriously.I don't have anyone who realizes or accepts what im going through, despite multiple attempts to reach out.I don't have any motivation to better my life or take better care of myself.I don't have any will to live.I don't feel like I have the right to feel this way and often feel guilty for feeling this way.I dont feel like im owed any of these things anyways, i know the world doesnt work like that.I do have emotional baggage, lots of it.I do have people that will miss me if i leave this world, but not enough that theyll check in on me knowing i feel this way.I do have tons of stresses and worries that seem to never end.I do have the capability to still smile, i know because i fake it every day at wotk and most social interactions.I do have depression, and its eating me alive.
