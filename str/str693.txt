I make reckless decisions, very poor financial choices.  I've prepared mentally for my world to crash and burn around me, I've had way too many drunken nights telling my dog that "no matter what, we will be together in Heaven."  I couldn't live my life like that anymore, the stress alone will kill you.  "You're only as sick as your darkest secret."  I couldn't be sick anymore.  Insomnia, guilt, shame, alcohol abuse, bad person.  Deep depression.  Rinse and repeat.Coming clean sometimes means losing the most important person in your life.  I prepared for it... But hearing your spouse wants you gone is never an easy pill to swallow.  I already mourned the loss of my life, for a goodcouple years now.  And now that it happened I don't even feel sad.  Almost like it isn't happening to me.
