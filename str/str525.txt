Maybe not helpful or relevant....I go to places regularly like the li rary and coffeehouse or even 7-1 and learn the clerks or baristas name.  Then be lame and read somewhere there are other people. Its pseudo social. But its qhat I did to slowly combat social anxiety. And there's that one person who remembers you.  Diners are good too.
