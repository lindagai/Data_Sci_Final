I feel like my life is getting worse and worse. My best friends are all gone. They left for various reasons, mostly due to my depression, and now without them I feel absolutely lost. I have no more close friends so I'm constantly alone at school, and anxiety attacks as well as stepping out of class to cry in the bathroom are common.Grade 12 has had both the best and worst moments of my entire life. My best friend now wants nothing to do with me, calling me toxic. Another of my closest friends, one who saved me from self harm and convinced me to tell my parents about my depression after 4 long years, did that as well. My best buddy who I'd known for 7 years or so called me worthless and said I have no redeeming qualities. Awesome.On top of severe depression and anxiety as well as being suicidal, I'm beginning to suspect I'm developing schizophrenia as well. I'm hearing voices. They're of my former best friends and they're telling me to kill myself because nobody wants me around. Somebody please help me. I'm in so much pain and I'm all alone. Please help me before I do something stupid to myself.TL;DR: All of my former best friends left me and now hate me. I believe I'm developing schizophrenia. Please help me.
