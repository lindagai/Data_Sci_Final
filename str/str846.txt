I couldn't think of a decent title because I just don't know how to label what I feel deep down inside.Everyday of my life I feel like an idiot. I'm lazy and I lack ambition or motivation. I'm 17 now and all my life I just drift through life. The ironic thing is I'm quite outgoing but life is meaningless to me even though I also love it at the same time. I'm also very mad at the world and everyone in it. There are times where I see nothing worth liking in people. These days the only thing that I like doing is just drinking whiskey and smoking. It's the only thing that takes the pain away. I don't want to kill myself but I often think about it. I think about dying and watching everything fade away. Things like relationships with the opposite sex have lost their appeal for me. I just don't find women that attractive anymore. I can't even masturbate because every time I even think about porn or women I'm disgusted.  This is just how I feel and sorry for the incoherency.
