I wish I could die in a freak accident so I would be dead but my family wouldn't think it's suicide. I know it's still hurtful but atleast they wouldn't think I did it myself. I actually got into a car accident a year ago. I fell asleep behind the wheel due to being drowsy because of new meds and the car went off the road into the woods. I hit a tree but just got some cuts. Everyone couldn't believe how calm I was after but nobody knows how much i wish I didn't walk away from the accident.
