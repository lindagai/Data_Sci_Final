I'm just trying to be, not even happy, I gave up on that when I was a kid. But I just want to be okay, to have some assurance that my life won't be universally shit forever, and I can't find it. I have no friends, I fail uni, I can't do anything alone and everyday I just want to kill myself. No one will ever like me, no one ever has, nothing I can do about it, just the way it is. I just feel so fucking powerless and I can't die and I've tried and I just can't and oh god I wish I fucking could.
