No one in my life cares. It's been 13 years since diagnosis. Probably had it longer than that and nothing ever changes. I'm really isolated and I do make the effort to socialise. But days just blur into one another with no warmth, love or affection. All I do is work. I've wasted whole weekends in bed because I've had nowhere to go and no one to go with.  I'm so tired of living with my mother and sister. My father lives some distance away. I've only known him 5 years and he won't hear any criticism about my mother and he doesn't understand my depression. I haven't developed since I was 24. I don't really know who I am
