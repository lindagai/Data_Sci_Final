I just turned 18 two days ago. Been in therapy for over a year. On various prescriptions that are meant to adjust my depressive and borderline behavior and make living a bit more tolerable. It was working. However I'm in a bunch of situations that removing myself from is...difficult. I won't go into detail on them other than the fact that it feels inescapable. I've been having bad thoughts for a while now, and I've contemplated surrendering myself to the psych ward. I've talked about it with my therapist and I'm unsure how I feel about it. I want to get away from everything, all of these daily triggers, in an environment where I preferably can't access internet or my phone. I want to go away, for I believe that it's my only chance of getting better. It's not like I can up and move away. I just need a couple days to just go. I can't get a hotel room or something like that because 1. Overprotective parents and 2. verrrryy little money. So the question is: Is there any less extreme version of a psych ward that I could temporarily check into? I know that I could do a 72 hr evaluation at the hospital but I'm not sure how I would feel about that. Also, considering I just recently turned 'adult', I'm not totally comfortble with being housed in an adult ward. All I know is that I need to get better and I can't do that in my current location.
