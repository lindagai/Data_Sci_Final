Hi r/depression, I am 19 years old and have had depression all my life. Last year I did something questionable and it has been hanging over my conscience since then, causing me feelings of guilt, shame, and fear. It's gotten to the point now where I can't really live with it anymore and want to get it off my chest to my therapist but I'm afraid if I do she'll be obligated to report me.It's in regards to sexting when the girl was 15 and I was 18. It has caused me severe depression over the past year because I know it was wrong and I am afraid of facing consequences still.    So my question is should I tell my therapist about it? I really want to get over this and start living my life again and this seems like the best way but I don't want to make things even worse.
