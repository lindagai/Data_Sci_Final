I also like how analytical you are! At least you have that going for you (I know, I know... that doesn't bring you solace or make you feel good).If you don't have an internal believe/faith that therapy/drugs can permanently rewire some individual's brain chemistry (or don't feel that you personally have the chance to be in lucky population of people), and you cannot find a way to relax your brain chemistry while healing-- you probably won't pull out of this and your points are valid.While I haven't been able to change myself either, I haven't been seriously trying to for very long. One interesting quirk in human neurology is something called a habit. Habits take tons of effort to form, but once done long enough, they become effortless. For example, brushing teeth, saying thank you, driving to work. Your brain pathways strengthen in the pathways controlling these behaviors, such that electricity is under less resistance and flows to these areas easier. My hope is that via a combination of drugs and CBT, I will be able to habituate thinking and feeling happiness and joy such that I return back to a normal human state. Definitely do not dive into a drug habit if one of your main issues is an inability to feel happiness or pleasure. That is a slippery, temporary and unforgiving slope for most people.
