I'm so nerdy and introverted that I'm speaking to you over a computer. We can't even talk in real life, haha. And to be honest with you, I don't think enough people have the words \"stiff\" and \"robotic\" in their vocabulary for you to be described as such by so many people.Flaws can be appearance or personality oriented. Denzel Washington broke a finger when he was a kid, and it's still crooked. Some people are so squeamish they may not ever want to look at his hands, but look how many movies he stars in! People are willing to overlook that and literally pay to watch him on screen, his odd finger and all. Oh, and the famous musician Paul Stanley from Kiss? He has no ear canal on his right side, meaning he's about half deaf. Yet he makes popular music that people cherish. He literally can't hear out his right side, but he makes better music (a hobby which requires you to *hear*) than most people with perfect hearing. I can't attest for any celebrity's personality flaws--just know that they have them, and despite that, they are well known and loved.So what are your favorite video games?
