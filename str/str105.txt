I've been staying with a friend's mom. I had no choice, she threw my shit out and blamed me for finding out because I went through her phone. I put out close to fifty applications in two days and it's starting to get to me that I havent heard a peep. I mean I'm doing all I can to cope with my mental shit on top of all this stuff that's been going on. Really though, I just feel stupid for feeling happy for a few months
