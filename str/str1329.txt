I think this is normal. I would bet money most, if not all, people have these very casual thoughts. I also don't think these are suicidal thinking (because you're literally just repeating words "I should kill myself sometime" and not actually *thinking* about it) and you're far from attemting suicide. I personally don't worry about me having these flash ideas.
