I'm 23 and honestly I am in a bad place in my life. I'm not going to say everything in my life is bad, no. I'm a cyber security specialist but quit. I hate myself so much it makes my head hurt. Literally. As a child I was... well... abused. All kinds. Not limiting the type; drugged, physical and sexual. I never told anyone. I know it's my fault. Even though I was 8 I knew better than to ask for something -- and because I was a burden, it happened for something I didn't need but wanted -- which was to not be alone. I'm in such self-loathing, it scares me. I was suicidal since I was 7 but I only remembered my past recently. I'm in therapy for it but barely talk about it. Hear things. See things. Most likely because of PTSD. But I'm unable to love. Live. Accept anything. I screw things up consistently. Hate LOVE and kindness more than I do being alone but I hate that too. I'm not a fan of positive thinking although I know about it. Life doesn't work like that. It won't magically "get better." If I'm not able to work, accept love, give love/trust, what purpose do I serve, really? For the past year, once a week, I've been thinking of ways I could commit suicide, writing all the different ways down on paper, lying to my therapist telling her I'm fine and I do it so believably it feels like I'm truly alone fighting a battle I can't win even though I know help is in front of me if I accepted it, but I won't ask for help, I can't. Not after I got what I so wholeheartedly deserved for asking for help as a child for the first time. There are so many people who go through worse and I feel like a burden taking up my therapist's time. I'm just one in a bunch of people and I personally don't matter. I was even held at gunpoint at one point and I yelled "Nothing would make me happier" when they threatened me. But they unfortunately got so weirded out they just put it away and walked off. So there's a lot there.
