I want to tell my mother and girlfriend that I want to die because I can't live like this anymore. I am in such a bad place that I won't be ever able to get out. I will never be content with myself, my appearance specifically. In order to function and avoid being depressed I stopped looking myself at mirror even when I shave I try to do it but eventually I do it and I end up in a really bad place in which I am right now. I realized that this isn't life and this is not the way normal people behave and I don't see myself accepting the way things are. This is not something new that happened, no this feeling i have for quite some time. I want to tell this to my mother but she is a single mother working really tough job (taking care of mentally retarded children) for 7 years and her health is fucked and that is just one in the million of things going wrong for her and I just don't want to upset her anymore because she doesn't deserve that. If I said that to her she would be really sad and I can't just can't do that anymore. I can't tell my girlfriend because last time I told her something about me being really depressed or something she couldn't sleep and now she has exams and I really don't want her to lose any sleep because of my problems. I am surrounded by people but in the end I am completely alone. I don't know what I am expecting from other people if I say this I guess this is because I feel so alone in this but in the end I know I will be dissapointed in the unsatisfying response. When they tell me "I love you" it doesn't mean much to me because it is not the solution. I really wish I could die saving somebody so I don't have to kill myself.
