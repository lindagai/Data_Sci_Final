You're still so young. Graduating high school?! I bet many of us wish we could be back at that point in our lives. Let me tell you one thing, the pain of a breakup doesn't last forever, and there's a very real chance that what you may perceive as negative now will actually turn out to be a positive later. This is just my own example, but when I didn't get into the University I wanted straight out of high school I was so sad and felt like a failure because all of my friends with better grades were going off to college. If I hadn't stayed home another two years and gone to community college, there is almost no chance I would have met my now girlfriend of five years. We get married next year :). So just keep on living each day my friend, because you can never ever know what is in store for you.
