For the love of good I hope someone has the balls to finally put me out of my miserable existence. My life has lost all direction and point. I've de-evolved to the point of waking up, playing overwatch, and going to sleep. If someone would kill me now and immortalize me as a good person so I could not slink lower than I have it would be best. My life has no impact on anyone except for the people in a skype chat who are in the same position as me. I want to fucking die
