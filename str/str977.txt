I've been struggling with trying to get a therapist appointment, but the soonest one available for intake is in the middle of August. I feel like I'm getting worse every day. I want to kill myself, and I am so close to doing it I'm making plans of how to do it the easiest way and how to hurt the least amount of people when I do it.  Nothing I used to love matters anymore. I feel like the world is a painting and everything is in color but I'm grey. I want to get out. I don't see anything ahead of me and all of my plans for the future are dead.The worst part is I have no reason to be this ungrateful. I have a great life and I have so many opportunities. I'm a waste of good resources at this point. I don't even want help anymore. I am only doing this because I promised my boyfriend I would wait 6 months to see if things get better before I do it. But I don't want to wait and I don't think things are going to get better. I don't know what to do anymore.
