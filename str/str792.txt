I've always been that good kid in school, always eager to learn and work hard. I have had a bit of trouble with turning things in on time, but this year it's even worse. I have my last day of school tomorrow but three big projects I need to start and finish... two of them are weeks late. I don't know if I will even bother trying, there's no time. The lowest grade I've had is a B- but now I'll get a new low: a D. I'm really tempted to just run away again and go to sleep but I need to do something... I can't focus on anything and I just want to cry and pretend nothing's wrong. I can't live with the fact that I messed up my life because of this... no more good colleges for me. How can I try and focus on my projects and get at least something in... help.
