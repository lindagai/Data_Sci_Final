Don't even know what I'm meant to type here, my life feels empty and shit, my girlfriend broke up with me for some reason I'm yet to know, my parents are divorced and don't speak, my dads a chronic alcoholic and gambler, my mum visits once a week If we're lucky, my brother doesn't speak to me, my nan can't remember me, my grandads dead, the other has cancer, my dog died last week, I don't like my work, I just eat takeaways and junk, I don't exercise, all my friends are busy doing their own thingsAnd the worst part is, all of it doesn't bother me, aside from my girlfriend I couldn't care less that my mum doesn't visit or my dads throwing his life away.The most recent was my girlfriend, and has just thrown me over the edge.Everyday I wake up and wonder what it would be like to just be dead, every time a car passes I wish I had the balls to just throw myself in front of it, I've never had thoughts like this, but now they're here they won't go away.
