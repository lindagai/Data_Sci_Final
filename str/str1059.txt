I hate everything guys. No matter how hard I try to progress and fix my past mistakes, they always manage to follow me. I'm never going to be happy. No one is ever going to be able to love someone like me. I'm a fucking wreck. I feel that now I am fixing past issues, it's already too late. I know I'm being vague but I kind of have to right now. Thanks for helping me through so much of the tough shit I've dealt with. You guys really have done a lot for me. I know I'm always going to be alone. It's unfortunate. But I probably deserve it. I want to die but I'm too much of a pussy to do it myself. I wish I could hire a hitman to come kill me. Would be easier than all the rejection and shit that life is putting me though. Fuck.
