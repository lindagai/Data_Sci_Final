I don't think I consider myself a person anymore. I am a consciousness, drifting through life. Everything i do is so boring and generic. I want to run away from home, go live in the goddamn woods. A tiny change in my life would be great, school is so routine that i feel i repeat history every day. I am wishing for cancer, as at least than i could have a set amount of time to live, rather than ending my life myself. I don't want to hurt anyone, and would love it if i could end it all involuntarily.
