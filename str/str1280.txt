I realized today that while I can (juuust about) live without weed for my chronic nerve inflammation (it sucks but I can deal) the real reason I want it so much is to distract myself from how much I want to die. Even when high I usually play multiple games at once - or just have a turn based game on my phone for loading screens. When I'm doing housework I have audio-books on. Anything to stop my brain from thinking, but without weed it'd not enough. My brain can play games, listen to books AND tell me how much I want to die. I just realized the last five and a half years I've been self medicating with weed, and without it I can barely cope. Especially WITH chronic inflammation. And before you say go on anti depressants, or go to therapy, neither helped. Anti depressants gave me the worst year of my life. I'm one of those people who FREAK THE FUCK OUT on them. Therapy just made me focus on the bad things, but didn't help me move past them. I just shove it all down, keep moving, keep working, and hopefully someday I'll be in a safe enough space to be able to actually go to therapy and deal with all the things I need to deal with. But that's not going to be for a long, long, long time. I wish I could just fall asleep and never wake up again, and that it wasn't my fault. Or y'know, just get baked out of it and get shit done. Of course it's not legal here, so that's kind of a problem.
