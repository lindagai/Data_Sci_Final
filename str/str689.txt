Limbo is hell. Limbo in my eyes and what's been my reality for at least 2-3 years now is that I'm back and forth in wanting to live and die. I'm 16(m) roughly average size and weight give or take, and I'm so fucking unhappy. I've struggled with depression and anxiety for a good chunk of my life and have personal reasons against meds. I feel alone. I feel like I'm just a fucking nobody. A white kid who listens to metal and draws grim dark things just because it's fun to me, and I don't belong. Believe me I've tried, I've fucking tried to find a common ground with others. It only lasts for a while, then just fades away slowly. Like a book page slowly yellowing over the years, but my friendships fade away in a matter of months it almost seems. My grades are crap. I'm smart, but don't do well in school. I'm stuck. I'm fucking stuck. So onto limbo. To me it's being caught between wanting to blow my fucking head off, and wanting to live life balls to the wall. I'm tired of it. My overthinking and body image problems plague me day and night. I'm tired of feeling lost, ugly, alone, fucked up, and above all, not good enough...I don't want to live anymore, but can't put the pills in my gut or the bullet in my head. I have a few things to live for, but then I have to question. Do I simultaneously curse the things I love for binding me to this nihilistic, pathetic existence? Sorry if this came off as rambling. I'm not very good at opening up about the whole limbo thing and this is only my second time posting anything on Reddit. Comment if you'd really like, maybe some one else can relate to thus feeling of limbo.
