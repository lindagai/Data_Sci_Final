Hello, I know what you feel like. I don't got the courage to kill myself although if I were to die accidentally or something, I'd be okay with it. Everyday is a fight. I'm slowly dying inside. My friends have had enough of my outbursts and told me to go. I'm really lost. PM me if you'd like to talk about stuff. How we can solve these problems
