I mean, my Dr is making things really difficult to get things done. Since my health insurance is to expensive at work I keep going to the same Dr. I just pay cash. I am switching through anti depressants to figure out whats right for me. I mostly take it so I can get anxiety medicine which is a controlled substance. Kind of like the Dr. wants me to take it in order to receive my anxiety meds.Last thing My stats are falling at work because of my medication making me sick, ya know the body getting used to it. I can't take anymore time off to go to get my dr to write an exception for my HR department.  Sorry just ranting. TLDRI am kind of done dealing with everything and medical professionals make it as hard on me as possible. I think I am just done.
