I had a dream that I was in love, passionate, heart pounding love. I awoke to my usual life very sad. I didn't know until now what a love less marriage i am in. My husband is mentally ill, he takes anti psychotic medications for severe bi polar manic episodes. My daughter has CP and I am her primary caregiver along with being my husband's primary caregiver. No one looks out for me but me. I thought my life was ok until I felt the freedom of love in my dream. In my dream a man I used to know loved me and he protected me. It was utterly blissful. I didn't have the worry of making surey husband and daughter took their meds and ate right. I didn't have the worry of keeping them safe. Now that I am awake I am bitter for the moment I felt taken care of and snuggled in his warmth. I want to die to feel that safety again.
