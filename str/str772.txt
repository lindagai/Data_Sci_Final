I search for a way to deal with how I feel but meditating or talking to people is just not an option. I want to die, I don't want to commit suicide or anything, I just don't want to be here on Earth anymore. I don't believe in love anymore, my depression and anxiety has started a new spiral; and, I feel like as opposed to finding a rhythm in life, I have just found a steady stream of struggles. Everyone around me seems to be unhappy, their relationships are just barely holding together (including my own) and that alone is making me question what the point of life is. Why does any of this matter? I am not happy, no one seems to be happy so what is the point of continuing? let's be honest, those brief moments of joy certainly can't help you overcome the pain. My heart hurts, my mind races, I shake, I cry and all I can muster is moments of pacing strewn with laying down and staring at space. I have a family function coming up and I seriously am sitting here praying that lightning will strike me or I might get hit by a car. I don't want my loved ones to be sad, but I just don't know if I can do this anymore. I don't want to be alone but if my best friend can't handle staying with me anymore, how could anyone else ever want to? Not to mention how fucked up this planet is. Everyone argues with each other, people are dying all the time for stupid shit, some people have nothing and can't seem to change their circumstances. I always grew up so protected - told I would amount to something, but here I am and the truth is I am not at all special or remarkable, I am meant to struggle like everyone else. I've never been a religious person, more spiritual, but even that I don't believe in anymore. I can't even ask a higher power to help because I just can't believe there would be a god, with all of this fucked up-ness. I keep reading hoping I'll find some light to help me out, but the only peace I get is from weed. I am so sad, I am so depressed, I feel so chaotic.
