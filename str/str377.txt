I'm really not. I sleep very little, so I'm tired all the time. My gf is in Australia, so I stay up late just to get a few minutes with her before bed because I'm so lonely without her that if I don't make the effort, then I can't sleep well at all... So, I get 4 hours of sleep at night before work and it's really not enough so I'm going through my day completely lethargic. I'm falling asleep when I get home, or if I'm not, I just feel terribly depressed because I have nowhere to go. I used to meet some friends on Thursdays, but lately I've felt as though I'm not wanted because the invites to come out haven't come in a few months. Last week I asked if they were going out, but was told they were out of town that week... I don't completely buy it. I'm really struggling right now and I feel like I'm trapped in a life that I hate.
