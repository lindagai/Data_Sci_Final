Hey... So i've considered making this post for a few weeks, and I finally did it. I'm in my mid-twenties, and because of how the uni system works here, i'm basically off until september. It's been one and a half week, and i' bored to death.I have very few friends, and when we're together, it's all fun and shit. But recently, one of the guys has stopped taking part. We used to write and see each other all the time, and i've not seen him the past 3 weeks. I've asked several time if he wants to me up and do something, and he rarely reply and if he does, its' just the same "yeah we should do that some time". I sit for hours waiting for him to reply, and i'm apologizing for spamming etc. - i fear that it reach a point where he just thinks i am a waste of time.Due to my low friend situation, and the fact we've been friends since forever, it's starting to bother me. I feel like shit, because I fear that he doesn't want to hang out anymore. He has apparently found interest in some new people, which is a-okay, but I am starting to feel lonely. At uni, i'm as unpopular as can be. No one likes me, and even though i talk to people, i'm that guy that sits alone. Haven't had a girlfriend since i was 14, and i feel like i am going nowhere.Recently, i've been putting on a lot of weight, and i've started to feel like shit every day. I am not even doing too well at uni, and I am probably not going to finish it in 3 years.Honestly, I feel alone, i hate the summer. Everyone is going to exciting places, and I am going to sit alone for 3 fucking months.I've started to consider just to end it all, because i will probably end up as a person with no friends, and my life so far has been pathetic. I'm a huge fucking dissapointment, and i honestly hate pretty much everything about myself.I feel alone... and i've considered suicide several times over the last 2-3 years where my life has been up and down. I just don't have any hope left.
