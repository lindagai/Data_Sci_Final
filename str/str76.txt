It's a weight off my shoulders to accept that I'm hopeless, incompetent, and stupid. I don't know what I'm doing, and people shouldn't depend on me. But then, to keep surviving is just to be a leech on the world around me.Right now I wish I could just go to sleep, and immediately go back to sleep every time I woke up. I don't want to do anything, but I don't want to be a part of the world if I'm not going to contribute to it.There are probably many people in the world, and all I'm doing is using up resources while staying totally invisible and inconsequential. I would like to make myself matter, but I guess I just don't have the energy. I feel like I'm playing a game I've already lost and am not allowed to concede. I guess that would be selfish.Instead I'll just keep doing my family some kind of favor by staying in, and probably not ever growing up or doing anything. It would just be nice if nothing was expected of me.
