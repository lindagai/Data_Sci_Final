i know, i have felt like this recently, just get what you can done  man it sucks having that much to do and I am freaking out with just one course a month, but if you can talk to your school maybe they can help you with at least the school related stuff, reach out to them, I did to mine and I have a phone number to talk to someone if I start freaking out again.
