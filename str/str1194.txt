My childhood was riddled with suffering rape and molestation for years, a single mother who relocated constantly resulting in constant making and losing of friends. And more.Now, in the last month, my relationship of five years suddenly ended, my best friend passed away, i was sexually assaulted, living alone in solitude, not sure if I can afford it.I'm an emotional wreck, but I'm gradually getting better, I think. I can't sleep though. I think I averaged 3 hours of sleep a night this week. I've been taking Melatonin and that helps for the initial getting in to bed, but I wake up in a handful of hours and can't go back.I'm trying to do better for myself, each day I try to be with friends for safety and camaraderie. But this lack of sleep is undoing me.Last night I sent to the bar with some friends and I decided I would drink a bit extra in order to hopefully pass out for a good bit. It doesnt help, I wake up feel ing like it's been 5 hours but its only been 2.5The break up has got me all kinds of messed up , and I want to get back together. We had a good strong one but I ended it when we moved a out an hour and a half away. I'm giving him space and might contact him after a week of radio silence. This is not helping but I've had trouble sleeping all my life
