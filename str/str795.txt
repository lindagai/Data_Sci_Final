Now I've never been formally diagnosed with depression. However, I was diagnosed over a year ago with GAD (generalized anxiety disorder). Over the past nine to ten months, I have suffered from what I've dubbed "depressive episodes" which are extended periods of sadness that will go away but only after like a week or even longer. I don't think they're long enough to be classified as depression but I'm not sure and I'm unfortunately not in the position to get the answers\help that I need. Essentially, anything is a trigger for these episodes. This makes living really difficult. My feelings of hopelessness are attached to that fact that I can't get help and will not be able to for at least the next 2 years. Turning 18 will help but moving out will help even more. Does anyone else go through these "episodes"?
