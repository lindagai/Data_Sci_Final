Hey, thanks for the insight. It's definitely a healthy state of mind to be able to recognize the destructive tendencies in your thought processes. I also often long for ignorant bliss.It most certainly can get better, I'm just having a hard time getting my feet in the water. It sounds like you have a pretty good understanding of your situation and what you need to do to improve it. I definitely can vouch for the benefits of strenuous physical activity. I haven't studied much of this recently, but I'm pretty sure it's got a whole lot to do with endorphins and clearly has a direct positive impact on stress levels. On top of that, there isn't much that is more satisfying than looking in the mirror and actually noticing your gains (or losses, not sure what your goal is). Huge confidence boost. And if you're talking about weightlifting, nothing gets me more motivated to improve myself than working up a pump and seeing what I could be with just a little more work.Not sure what kind of relationship you're pursuing with your coworker, but as long as it's a positive influence I hope you hold onto that.I hope June is awesome for the both of us. I tend to lose track of notifications and messages and such, but I will try to keep myself posted on your progress.
