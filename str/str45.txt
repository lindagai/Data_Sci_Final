Hey, big congrats man!  Keep up whatever you're doing because it's obviously working.Just some advice for when this mutual monster on our backs starts to gnaw at you.  *Never* believe it when you think shed be \"better off without you\".  That is not your call to make alone, it is hers.  Trust in her strength and offers yours to her when you can.
