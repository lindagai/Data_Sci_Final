=(There has to be some way you can talk to someone. That's a lot of shit for anyone to go through. I feel you on the cancer thing. My mom died of cancer almost 9 years ago, and I too know the feeling of being helpless/ hopeless. I actually tried to kill myself the second time my mom got cancer. We all need an outlet. And so far, this thread has helped me a little. You can't give up though. Is there anyway you can see your sister? Or tell her what's going on? I'm so sorry you have to go through all this, but assuming you're young since you almost graduated, there's more life ahead of you, even when you lose someone. Losing my mom was the hardest, most painful thing I've ever dealt with, and probably ever will. I'll never be over it, but I'm still here. Talk to people on here. Stay connected and don't give up.
