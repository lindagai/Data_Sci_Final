I've already taken my meds, and gotten high and the panic waves are still rolling. (and yeah, normally weed seems to help with the anxiety, probably not long-term thought? I'm trying and trying to quit ). My best friend / on-and-off again boyfriend are in some tense complicated times, trying to make everything work, and I don't have many people I can turn to. (or at least turn to over, and over, again). I'm struggling to find the motivation to work on school applications , but these are just things, right?things. life has good and bad and mostly neutral things that we decide how to think about. life is overall pretty good, I have lots of anxiety but my depression is taking over. I have been crying all the time and I can't figure out how to be okay with life again. It feels like my fucking chest is collapsing, my stomach is in knots I haven't been able to eat much today, and I haven't been motivated enough to go to any store in weeks. I wish I had something here, but by this point I'm not hungry. Just hurting. I can't figure out how to get okay with things again.I'm not threatening suicide. I'm saying I can't stand this pain. And I don't have any more options.
