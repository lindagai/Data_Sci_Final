I have known this for years. Everything is flat and grey. I have to force myself to eat. I've lost passion for all the things I used to enjoy. I can no longer write. I can no longer draw. I am useless and fail at everything I attempt to do. I have been lonely for years and all I want is someone to hold, but it will never happen. I can no longer tell mental and physical pain apart but I do know that everything hurts so much and I am so, so tired. I wish I had never existed, because right now I am too weak to kill myself. But one day I will.
