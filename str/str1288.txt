I think about it every day. Meditation helps. Knowing other people that are going through it helps a lot. Going out and just making yourself "content" in social environments helps, if you can. My cats help a shit load, probably knowing that something specifically depends on you. This shit sucks. This shit is real. If I could kill myself and hurt nothing, I would. Sometimes I wish I had nobody, but then I think about it... I realize I want to see so much more, so I can see if I find something to care about (besides my cats and depressed friends hahaha)
