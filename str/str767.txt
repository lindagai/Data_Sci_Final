I'm a 17 year old male. I'm tired of being alone, I'm tired of being in constant sadness. I guess I'll give a little back story. Been through foster care, overweight now, no real close friends, bring gay as well. Always sad and lonely. Made a few friends in the past few weeks. Hurt one of them and I feel so awful they don't want to talk to me anymore, I just want to die. I get close to someone and I ruin it, I ruin everything, I'm tired of it.I want to OD, but worried of surviving and ruining organs.  I want to stab myself, but the pain terrifies me, worried of surviving as well. Want to stick metal object in electrical outlet, worried of surviving and ruining brain. Want to shoot myself but I have no gun. I have even thought of calling police and coming out with knife (not going to hurt someone, that would be breaking my code of ethics) but they don't know that and they shoot me to death. Have thought of jumping in front of moving car, thought of surviving and being damaged scares me.I just can't, I just want it to end.
