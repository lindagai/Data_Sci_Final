When I was 15 I was put on prozac, I ended up experiencing a lot of rage as a side effect and went off of it within a month. Tried Celexa after that, it worked but I went off of it because I wasn't ready to take medication everyday. I've tried Celexa, Lexapro, Abilify, Welbutrin, Topomax, Clonazapam, Vistiril. I've had a few side effects with some but currently I'm without insurance and the first time in 10 years being off meds. So I'm taking supplements 5-htp, magnesium, folic acid, pre-natal vitamins, and fish oil. I've been on the supplements for about 4 months now and it  seems like my emotional cycles are occurring more often.
