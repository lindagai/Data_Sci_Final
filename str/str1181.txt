Hi,I am a 32F with Dsylexia (reading comprehension below level of intelligence even though I'm above average intelligence according to testing), ADHD (inattentive type), and Dsynomia (difficulty recalling words). I also have generalized anxiety, and am an obsessive and compulsive perfectionist (ie pick at my skin), but I don't have the stereotypical OCD needs to perform irrational rituals. I take Wellbutrin (75 mg) and sometimes pair it with Concerta (15 mg) or Strattera (40 mg). Concerta helps, but I not as much as Strattera does with freeing my mind from anxious suffering and obsession. Other ADHD stimulants  like dextroamphetamine give me focus and energy but cause too much anxiety.Strattera would be the miracle drug that helps me actually control my thoughts so I'm not obsessing and can focus, but taking it has these 4 issues:1) It stops being as effective after a few weeks or I desensitize to it so need to take a higher dose.2) It causes extreme constipation even if I take Citrucel fiber pills.3) It takes away pain but it also takes away sexual pleasure.4) It causes cotton mouth but that's the least of my worries.What can I do? I find myself half-ass taking my meds because of the 4 problems with Strattera.
