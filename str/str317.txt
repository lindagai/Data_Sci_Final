Is the job sufficiently well paid that your income could support both of you?  Why does she need to finish her degree right now?      Reflect on how immensely selfish she is if she insists that the only two options are: (a) you go, and she kills herself because you left; and (b) you stay for her, passing up the possibility of creating a better future for yourself (and her, potentially, and your possible kids).    If she's willing to kill herself if you leave, she ought to be willing to suspend her academic endeavors and go with you.    You owe it to your future self to not just pass up this job opportunity.  And she owes it to you and to herself to not kill herself over it.
