And people have always told me that happiness cannot be influenced through the actions you share with others...You have been proven wrongPeople always say \"love yourself\" \"don't worry about other people\" (including the people you love or have a crush on) \"only you can make yourself happy\"Maybe people say this on purpose to keep you in the dumps and away from people because they want you to be alone....
