I really want to just kill myself because i know i will get nowhere in life. I'm a no-life loser that will be alone for the rest of my life because i cant keep friends. I can barely stay up in school with C's and D's and my mother is already dead and my father will probably be soon. Despite all of this, i cant seem to bring myself to it, like something is blocking me. Why?
