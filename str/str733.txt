Hey, so i am 13 and a female i was diagnosed with aspergers syndrome and PDA (pathological demand avoidance) and anxiety at a young age. I have always had difficulty socialising and behaving 'normally', since the start of secondary school my social skills have improved massively witch is great! however my PDA has got worse and leads to be getting angry and expressing panic attack like behaviours when being asked to do simple tasks by my parents. for some reason i can control these behaviours at school recently my parents have began to blame me for this and we fall out so often. I hate myself I feel useless sometimes I just want to die. I'm a disappointment to my parents and i think they hate me. I upset them so much they would be better off without me. I suffer from panic attacks over small things like my parents not answering the phone first time. I love them so much and I dont want to hurt them. I have had a lot more self harm urges recently, It started with hitting myself and scratching my skin with sharp objects (not drawing blood). however its getting worse, I drew blood for the first time last night not a lot but i feel terrible yet i feel the urge to do it again. I need help i am on fluoxatine pills for anxiety and depression and was getting sessions with cahms for a while but i have been discharged and they wont offer me any more counselling. My parents can't deal with it and neither can I. anyone who can help or give me advice please I really need it.
