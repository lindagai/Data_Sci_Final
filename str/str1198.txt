(I'm 18 years old in America, if it matters)I have general anxiety, and I've become fairly good at managing it except in one aspect. I have bad anxiety towards driving, to the point where I can't sleep the night before I have to drive as I'm so anxious to do so. Ive been job hunting as well, and I've been struggling so much with panic attacks and the constant fear of just having to drive that I can't prepare myself for the interview. I live in a rural area about 20 minutes from the nearest town so biking or walking is out of the question, but next to a freeway and a winding mountain road so I can't practice on a safe dirt road (I'm mostly anxious about driving around towns and cities anyways.) My mom has agreed to take me driving (driving with others eases it a bit) but we don't have enough gas money for me to practice as much as I feel I need to, and if I get a job I'll have to start driving alone whether I'm comfortable doing so or not. And I do have medicine for anxiety (trazodone, for depression and anxiety) but it makes me tired so I can't take it while driving. I read that anxiety towards driving is fairly common, so if anyone has *any* personal experience or advice towards me I would very much love to hear it. Thank you in advance to everyone who comments!
