Never had a job, or a girlfriend, or learned how to drive. My face is decent looking but my body is frail, I'm so physically repulsive it sickens me. All my high school friends have gone their separate ways, and I've just failed my first semester at uni. I feel as though I'm doomed to spend the rest of my life living with my parents, on my computer, accomplishing nothing. Some days I'm ok but others I feel like I want to die (I don't want to kill myself or anything, I just want to go to sleep and never wake up again). I don't so much as HATE my life, I'm just resigned to it. I'm not diagnosed with depression so this may not be the right sub but I just really need to vent my frustrations.
