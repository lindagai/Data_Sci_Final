Great, so we can destroy Earth and then move on to destroy other planets one by one... The only way AI will help in the long run will be when we create machines smarter than us, who build even smarter machines, until they are independent enough to realize that humanity is a plague that is killing the planet. Then the AI will **rightfully** extinguish humanity. If nothing stops us, we'll move on to other planets and eventually other solar systems, and destroy whatever we find there. We're parasites.
