Meditating doesn't help. Talking about it doesn't help. All the advice and steps you're supposed to take make me panic and sick to my stomach. I'm suicidal, not stupid. I'm aware of my flaws. I know what I'm "supposed" to do and what is lacking in my life. I don't wish I were dead because I haven't tried or considered the other options. I wish I were dead because not existing is more appealing than every other option.
