my whole life ive felt inferior about how small and skinny I am. ive always been really really underweight, like I graduated high school as a male weighing 94lbs. I've always lied about how much I could bench and how strong I was cause I've always felt self conscious about how weak I am. to say im obsessed with gaining weight would be an understatement. i feel nothing for anyone or anything anymore. all that matters is calories and the scale. every day is so scary knowing I have to hop on the scale and see the number. it's like anxiety to the point of nausea and if the number is low I freak out and start punching my wall and crying and breaking down why can't I gain weight what is wrong with me but it's like I only think about gaining weight I feel anxiety about actually gaining weight so it works against me cause I can't imagine myself being big or strong but at the same time I feel so much pressure to get Bigger and stronger it's just so much pressure that I can't handle it all I think anout and billsI always find my thoughts racing for the way out and it's always imagining death it feels cathartic laying in my bed imagining myself dead, at peace from all the inner commentary always going on back and forth never stopping contemplating the existence of God/politics/trivial topics/wanting to research historical significant events/ I can't stop the thoughts racing over and over it's maddening. I hide my food from my roommate so he can't see me eating cause it's like I feel so exposed and get 100x more anxious when other ppl see me eating trying to gain weight is there such a thing as reverse anorexia?
