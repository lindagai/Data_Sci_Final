School just ended... No one said goodbye to me, no one talks to me, no one likes me. I used to talk but since my depressive phase came back in May, I haven't been able to make jokes or talk to interact. I just wish someone would talk to me. I know it's bad but I can't take it anymore. I HATE watching people talk to other people when I wish they would talk to me. I've tried to talk to them. I've tried and tried again but people don't like me, don't talk to me. No girl has ever talked to me, only person who talks to me is a family friend but he is busy being popular and talking. There's this chemistry room people chill in at lunch and I sit there but no one talks to me. I can't stand it anymore. I want to someone to like me, someone to talk to me. I want to die. But not by suicide, by sacrifice for someone else. I wish people thought good of me. Everyone talks about this one kid who is super smart and people like him. I never get compliments, people never talk about me. Its like I dont exist. Hell I wouldn't get attention if I shot myself pointblank in the face in the middle of the room. Its bad, I'm some kind of attention craving selfish piece of shit but I want it, need it so bad. Even this is some kind of way of trying to get attention. Please kill me, someone or something...
