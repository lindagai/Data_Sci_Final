...or is my perception blurred. Can people hit a low just because they're not aware that their reality could be worse? I'm very aware that I don't have the shittiest life in the world and I also know that so many others have it way worse. Yet, I have suicidal thoughts and people who are worse off than me haven't broke under their situation.So what gives? I don't get how this works. How can it be all in my head when I'm self aware of a permanent solution to my suffering.
