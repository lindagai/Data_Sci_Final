Okay to start off I want to give a disclaimer. I do not have intent. I'm not going to kill myself, I have been to and conversed with others over at /r/suicidewatch I have read their resources and that's not what I need at the moment, this is predominantly a vent/conversation starter.     It's not everyday but I think about suicide often. I have manic depression and so there's never really a trigger to it or my depression in general.           I can be on my lunchbreak reading on my phone, or driving home from having a good time with my best friend, when all of a sudden I just get dismally depressed and start to go in deep thought about suicide.    I have done research on the cost of cremation and the price of having a will notarized. I think of how I would go. What specific tool.    Thinking about it in a logical sense makes me feel better. Knowing how much money I would need to leave in order to not be burden is not unattainable but still mildly daunting. When I get close to having enough I end up doing something else with the money and the cycle starts.      I have been depressed my whole teenage-adult life. It's something I live with. (Yes I also take medication) This has become just as much a part of my life as having a wheelchair. I have to make backup plans for everyday. (A high set and a low set) I have to make sure that anyone close knows what's going on with me so they don't feel they've done something. I also have to hide myself from coworkers and like associations in order to not arise too many questions as I am unreasonably ashamed of how weak I can get.     I am prepared to spend the rest of my life this way if I have to, although if preference played a role I wouldn't mind being less depressed. At this point I can't imagine living without my darkness. I become attached with that side of myself. I feel it's become apart of me, a good portion of my identity. I don't know who I am when I'm not in a shroud of shadows. I'm sorry this has gotten long, I just intended on wording some thoughts on suicide but I just kind of flowed out. I really just want to thank you if you read all of this and if any of it seems familiar, I would enjoy hearing your thoughts. I wish you all pleasant dreams and decent mornings. TL:DR: Fuck depression, but who am I without it?P.S. sorry if formatting is off. It's 2:30a.m. and I'm too tired to proofread.
