I can relate to this. Sometimes having the "comfort" of having suicide as a plan just makes getting through the day a little less of a drudgery, even tho life still sucks. I've actually planned a list of letters I have to write before I kill myself, which seems fucking stupid now that I write that out. But at the same time I think I'm going to go work on them now anyway. It sounds like you have a lot of job frustration especially - I'm not sure if that's your main concern, but I can see how it would be since jobs seem to basically define us. And I'm in a similar situation as you, where I don't make enough $$ to move out and I'm not qualified for anything. But if you're up to it, I could suggest something like a temp agency? That's what I'm working through right now, and while it's not ideal, it's better than nothing. They can line you up with jobs and you can try different things. The hard bit is that the places where you work can decide pretty quickly if they don't need you anymore. (For example, I did three weeks at a place and in the middle of a week, my temp agent called me and said the place didn't need me to come back -- not even to finish the week).Ack, I'm sorry for rambling. Is there something else maybe you can get training for, or does that cost money? I'm not familiar with trade jobs so I'm sorry that I can't be more help there.
