&gt; **Do not post or respond with**:&gt; &gt; &gt; * General uplifting or \"it gets better\" messages. **Encouragement is not helpful unless it integrates real, personal understanding of the OP's feelings and situation.**Your comment might as well be a horoscope. Sure, it might come true. That's because it's so generic that it could apply to anybody. Say it to enough people, and eventually you'll meet someone for whom it ends up being true. And you won't notice all the times you were wrong, because those people won't remember your post, so they won't call you on the fact that you were wrong.
