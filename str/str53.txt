I want to try talking about it but I've been pushing through myself for a few years now and I don't want to share/expose myself because I am scared. And I had a similar experience with uni, except I failed first semester because I was killing pain with drugs,. I took a semester off to get back on my feet but I just can't. I thought drugs would make me happy, they didn't. I thought quitting drugs would make me happy it didn't. I thought making money would make me happy it didn't. I'm trying to address the problems from the source but I am ill equipped.
