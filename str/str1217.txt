Sounds a lot like my situation, although my parents were deemed 'dangerous for my mental health' because neither would take me to the hospital when I warned them that I might harm myself after my girlfriend of 12 years cheated on me, and I was staying with them. I tried to hang myself and unfortunately got to the hospital that way. So then I got moved into a group home. I'm in Canada. The economic situation is Greece sounds absolutely horrible. I fear that the rest of the world is not far behind. I also have a hole in my heart and no interest in other women, and think about my ex every day, cry every day. Life has two states: holding back tears or letting them flow. It has been more than a year now. After 12 years, suddenly, no contact, just gone. Before she left for her trip, where she cheated on me, she told me I was being silly for giving her a CD of love songs that I wrote for her, because I was always afraid she would forget about me. I would always give her little notes to open every day when she went away, stuff like that. "Don't be silly, I will never forget about you!" Well, she forgot pretty quickly and effortlessly. I wanted to be with that girl forever.Our wounds will take a very long time to heal. I have no advice to offer you. I'm sorry.
