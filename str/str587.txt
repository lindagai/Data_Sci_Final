:/ The best advice I could give you, is to find a new friend(s). However, I'm not a very good person to give advice...But, anyhow, it's hard to see clearly what's going on with her; she might feel you neglected your friendship with her on purpose, or that you didn't care about it as much as she did - after a while, (I think) apologizing rarely goes anywhere.I know it can be heartbreaking, hell, most of friends I've had have long moved on, but...You could also try to pull her aside (when you see her at the party), and talk honestly to her. Ask her face to face why is she behaving this way, and ask her to be honest with you. You could also tell her what you basically wrote here - your side of the things, if that's what bothering her.Going from what you wrote, that's how I see it.
