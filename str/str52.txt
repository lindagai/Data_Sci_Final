   Well I got a new job so thats good. On the first day of training I was outgoing, talking, confident, cracking a few jokes. But let me tell you this mask is heavy and you can't hold it forever. I always put this mask on when first meeting people (but some of it is really me, and comes out naturally) so everyone thinks I'm a great or cool guy or something like that. But on the second day of training one of the trainers that I got along with picked me on the second day of training for one-on-one thinking he chose the same person he met. When he chose me I got anxious like I used to when I would hangout one-on-one with a friend. because thats where your true self will show, people will see you're putting on a front. 30 minutes in he asked me if I wanted to be here because I have a fuck work vibe on. well, it's not a fuck work vibe, its a fuck my life vibe. People get turned off when they see the real depressed me, on one wants to go hang out with a depressed person they're no fun, they have options to hang out with normal people and have a good time. Well when he said that to me it was break, I went to my car and cried. My old friends don't answer, no idea how to find more friends in this time in my life, and I'm tired of trying, I miss my old self.
