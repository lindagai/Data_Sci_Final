I've been alone, lonely, and depressed for almost my entire life. I won't get into it. If you're in this sub, I know you understand. The only reason I survived high school and my freshman year of college is because I still had the vague hope that things would improve for me. Also, the guilt of devastating my family was a pretty huge deterrent to killing myself. So anyway, I might have flat-out eliminated all hope from my life a few months ago. Not to brag or anything (nothing left to brag about, actually), but before this incident, I had a really nice dick. Like seven and a half inches long, thick, nicely shaped, the works. Like a porn star. I'm a virgin though and I was trying to figure out what size condom would fit me comfortably. I bought some condoms at a 7/11 and jerked off into one. Turns out it didn't fit, and it might have cost me my fucking life. It was so tight that it injured me. Possibly permanently. It did a ton of nerve damage, my erections are weaker and more difficult to maintain, \u007fand to top everything off, I have a fuckton of visible, dead, dark veins above my circumcision scar now. If this is actually permanent and untreatable, it's basically a guarantee that I'll never have a girlfriend. I'll never have any reason to get into better shape. My confidence will be at an all-time low. There will be no hope left for me. All because I used a product that hundreds of millions of people use every single day without issue. A routine trip to the 7/11 and my life is circling the fucking drain. I did nothing wrong. I didn't do anything out of the ordinary. Just my fucking luck. My doctor's appointment is in two days. It's absolutely surreal to think that these might be my last 48 hours alive.
