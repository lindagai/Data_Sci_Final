This is so difficult to explain. The main struggle I have is that EVERYTHING is a process of MY brain. I can only be sure of my consciousness and my '' reality ''. I cant be sure whether my friends experience the same things as me in my thoughts, surely they will say they do but how can I ever be sure of that. Ofcourse I'm not convinced that im the only actuall person on this planet, but I'll never get to be 100% certain of that. That just bugs my mind.The fact that I could choose to stop my consciousness, the ONLY actuall consciousness that I can be 100% sure about, is mind blowing to me. I could just end my life and that would be the end of MY reality and basically ALL reality. I dont know whether im getting my message across here, because it's hard to put this into words.I dont really look at this as a bad thing, because realizing reality only goes to your extent is a cool thing. But then again, also a mind blowing thing and it doesnt help with feeling lonely at all. Feels like I'm having a struggle between the good and bad side of things.
