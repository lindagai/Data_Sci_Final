Yeah, unfortunately not a lot of people will hire you for something non-minimum wage with a biology degree. You have to get a masters or a PhD in something more specific. I have the same problem. I wanted to be a physical therapist but I was so depressed in college I couldn't do the work and had to change my major to psychology. I did a lot better but not enough to really impact my GPA. So there's no way I'd get into graduate school. Now I make $11/hr. I was unemployed for 1.5 years prior to that.
