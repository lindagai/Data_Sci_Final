You're very, very insightful. I was (and am) often terrified of \"better\" because all I can imagine is a fuck of a lot of hard work. But if you think about it, \"better\" can maybe mean not that much work, either. Maybe we could both be crazy hermits doing nothing all day. It's hard to imagine the mood of happiness so we imagine the habits of a functional life, without the mood that makes it all okay.You're not lazy, you're tired, and your brain is telling you that all the things you think you should do just aren't worth it.You're not a coward, your brain is doing a risk analysis and you have a low risk appetite. That's ok, you'd probably be a great investor.Don't cut. You don't have to be unhappy to still deserve to be happy. You don't have to be depressed in order to be nice to yourself.Nobody gets what they deserve. Nobody. And a lot of people on here have gotten a lot of shit they don't deserve (cough cough me cough). Feeling guilty over your good fortune isn't going to make anyone on here feel better. It's not like you're taking AWAY from my happiness by having more than you once did.Give yourself a hug. Check back in in 10 minutes.
