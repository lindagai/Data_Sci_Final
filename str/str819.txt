I've attempted suicide once, last February. But before then, I did not look at things differently. In fact, ever since then I've felt that I've been in a suicidal limbo. Like, any day now feels like it could be my last. But after the attempt, I started to enjoy little things, some things I normally hate, like birds chirping in the morning. I love the sound of birds singing, now. When I left my apartment, this morning, I couldn't stop staring at the clouds. They're very pretty in the morning. When I took a shower, I was just standing there, letting water fill up in my cupped hand. I couldn't stop staring at it. I weirdly thought it was beautiful.I dunno. It's really weird. As much as I hate myself and I want to die, I find all of these little things so wonderful.
