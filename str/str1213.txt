I don't know if the feelings will go away. I've had low self esteem for what seems like forever, been overweight majority of my life. Trying to lose the weight here and there, I'm just terrified that when I lose this weight i'll still hate myself and my life and I will never be happy so I keep putting off going to the gym and eating healthier because I don't know what I'll do if I'm still unhappy with my life.
