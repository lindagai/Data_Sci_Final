Hi peeps!I'm not even sure if this should go here or maybe in suicide watch but it doesn't really matter. I just wanted to write it down and let it all out.Backstory time. I finished highshcool this year. Actually I still have a few exams. Well about in november we had a mock exam which I royaly messed up. I mean really really messed up. And then something changed in me. I just said one sentence to mysefl which I clearly remember. I give up on my life. And I did that. I just turned neutral to anything. I did not care what happened I just went with the flow. Which is good to some extant but I did it a lot. to the point where I messed up my exams and now I won't go to university. not like I really want to but still this was a blow. I was an a student all my life. But I just gave up when I messed up the exam. Well part of why I gave up was because I just don't have any friends anymore. All of them drifted afar from me and now I'm totaly lonely and don't have anything to do. I was on the verge of suicide about 4 times since then. Like sitting there with a knife in my hand to slit my wrist, or barely not jumping in fron of a moving train. I don't really want to die but I don't want to live.Thanks for reading! bye bye
