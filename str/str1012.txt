I can't do anything right, I feel so useless.I can't focus on anything, I'm always tired and physically sore. Broken another thing of my mum's as a result... two kitchen items in a month and she always takes accidents so personally.I have no interest in anything again, see no future.I want my Nosgoth back, for one year the world didn't feel so bad but now that's gone there's an even bigger hole in it's wake. It's like someone dangled hope in front of me then snatched it away again because they got bored.Call me selfish but I'm so done with living like this. I don't want to do it again.
