I've just finished a GCSE paper and heard some of the other students on the bus talk about the paper and everything I've heard, I wrote the opposite. These are the smartest kids in the class so I know I'm screwed and this isn't just 1 paper. I've had the same experience for all my papers. Kill me now. I failed where I should have passed. I don't buy any form of \"At least you tried your hardest and gave it your all right?\" That doesn't mean shit, only results matter. Results are the only things that matter, nothing else. If you can't get those results, you are worthless. And fuck off with the pretentious \"Oh your parents will understand right?\"  I have full Asian parents and to them anything below an A or A* is trash. I really don't know what to do. I want to kill myself, but can't bring myself to do it. I really don't know what to do.
