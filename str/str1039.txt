It's been over 2 months. I've had some good experiences with friends who have seen me twice since she passed. But when they leave I'm back into depression and laziness. My 2 year old son helps me live. I honestly would of killed myself by now if it wasn't for him. Sometimes I sort of resent him because I want to kill myself so bad. But, I can't because he needs me. I'm starting to go into manic depression. It's starting to become who I am, I don't know if I can pull myself out of it. I've had experiences with depression over 10 years ago in the army. I was able to pull myself out of it. I've never had this much of a problem before even though I attempted to kill myself then. This time if I ever would do it I wouldn't mess around. I want to be with her as fast as possible.
