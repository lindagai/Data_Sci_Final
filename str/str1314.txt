im 23 man... i have almost the same feelings you described above.. i just feel sad. where am i now? it's saturday and i am in my garage all alone, no text no fb messages, nothing and i just feel sad....lonely. actually i was just in the bathroom and i said i want to kill myself to but as you said it will take a toll... idk how to explain it but i get that crying feeling in my throat alot, just thinking and also when i express this fucking depression/anxiety issue.
