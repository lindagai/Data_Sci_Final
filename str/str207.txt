Lack of motivation really sucks.  And then the guilt about wasting that time shows up.  Which makes me not want to do anything.The only thing that really breaks me out of that rut is by either getting bored as fuck or making myself shower and leave the house and going and hanging outside for a while.  Nature is an excellent thing.
