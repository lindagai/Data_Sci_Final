I've just finished school and I've got nothing to do and no responsibilities, I know I should be psyched and making the most of it but even when I occupy myself I just feel lost/sort of just undecided how I feel. I switch from really happy and content, to feeling so low I could kill myself. I've always dipped in and out of depression throughout my adolescence and every time I feel like I've shaken it off it comes back to bite me again. Anyone got any advice on how to get that spark in my life again?
