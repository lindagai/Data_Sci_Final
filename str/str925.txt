I tried everything in the book, I got a successful career.  I got "friends" (I really don't care about relationships when my priority is losing my virginity.)  I have hobbies, I tried therapy &amp; medication.  But nothing is going to get over the suicidal urges because I'm a virgin.  I'm just so tired, I'm tired of waiting, I'm tired of the years of rejection.  I'm tired of trying to lie to myself to tell myself I don't want to lose my virginity just to cope with my life.  I wanted to lose my virginity but now I just want to die, I fucking hate living life as a virgin.  It just eats me up, I stop showing up to work everyday, I always cut my social circles because of how much I think about how I'm a virgin and I won't be able to lose my virginity.  I think the time is now to kill myself, I'm just waiting to purchase a gun from someone this weekend.
