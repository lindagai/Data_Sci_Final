I've been depressed since 8th grade.  One suicide attempt and another episode that landed me in the psych ward.  Even on medication it won't go away.I feel like my life has hit a dead end.  That there's nothing past my current state.  I've already taken leave from the school of my dreams and might never go back but I don't know what I'm supposed to do with myself.  My mom warns me my girlfriend, who is great at everything she does, will leave me if I don't keep pace with her level of success.I don't want to kill my self, but I don't want to live anymore because there's nothing out there for me.
