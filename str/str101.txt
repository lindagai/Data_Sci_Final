Because people know me from the past and the not person I am now I get very anxious and paranoid. I feel like I don't deserve to live or I should only live to suffer. It returns me to the intense need to tear off my flesh.I've worked hard to get here and fix my flaws, and I've done very well. Sure some of my flaws remain but I'm actively trying to educate myself about them.That thought haunts me though and I go through a cycle of hating myself to being proud of how far I've come. I've tortured myself for years because I thought I deserved the worst. Isn't that enough though? I've punished myself long enough, it's the present, I'm a better person than what I was then. Yet that thought comes back. It keeps coming back.The people surrounding me don't want to see me suffer or hate myself. So maybe that's the green light to give myself some slack. How do I accept the past and forgive myself?
