I think I'm depressed. I mean, I'm always plagued by intrusive, painful thoughts. I constantly want to kill myself. I have scars from trying to kill myself one time. If I do it again, I'll do it right. Something is definitely wrong with me. But I feel like I'm making it all up. Like, maybe if I tried a little harder, I wouldn't feel like this. Maybe I'm just lazy. After 1.5 years of heartache, I've finally opened up a little bit to my family and explained that I'm feeling depressed and that's why I've been failing to meet their expectations. They're understanding, but of course they don't totally get it. Or maybe they do, and I'm just a new breed of weakness, who takes things too hard.I'm just a failure, really. Now that they all know why I'm failing, I feel worse. Every time I sheepishly explain "I'm sorry, I've been really depressed lately", I feel like a loser. When they ask what exactly makes me depressed, I can't tell them. I give them a taste and they try to explain to me why I shouldn't feel bad about. It's more than that though, I can reason, but I can't *reason*. It's like there's a brick wall there. Nothing is helping, not for a while. I'm burdening everyone in my life. I just want to die and let them go on without me.
