How I feel: when I do something, it seems like everyone thinks I'm a dumb weird shitheadWhen other people do it, they're hilarious &amp; coolDay after day I want to kill myself more and more. It feels like the world is against me. I'm ugly, I have no sense of humor, I'm dull, I feel nothing and people hate it I guess. I can't laugh at jokes or feel joy, I'm like a black hole as they say.I left my house finally. I went on vacation. It only made me feel worse. I got told people are not going to have anything to say at my funeral, that I always look bored, etc.I'm thinking now that the next logical step is to try LSD. If I still want to kill myself after trying that, I'm going to overdose on heroin and vodka, an easy death. I'm sick of being ugly and disliked. I'm tired of always being bored and getting shit on just for existing. Sick of trying to live an impossible life. Ugly, lazy, useless, non-human..
