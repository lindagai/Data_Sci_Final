I dont know you, but one guy leaving you is okay! I can tell you from experience ( Having bpd and depression) That you will find someone who will love you, depression, psychosis and all. My best friend of three years (whom I loved) just stopped talking to me one day, saying my emotions were to much for him. I couldnt bear it, and i tried to commit suicide. I never thought anyone would ever care about me ever again, until I found her.TL;DR You will find someone who will love and support you, you just gotta keep looking! Best of luck.
