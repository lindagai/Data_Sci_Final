I should be one of the people who are supposed to be really happy about their fortune.I should be happy that i am born into a healthy and wealthy family who supports me and tells me how much they love me. But i still which i was never born. I always think people hate me. I always think I am a waste of resources. I am the waste of the money my parents put into me to ensure me a good future. I feel really stupid to be sad and depressed over such thing since i have everything you would need to leed a happy life. Lots of friends, girlfriend, good education and other luxuries. And still i feel like i didnt deserve it at all. I feel like everyone would be happy if i was gone. I don't understand for myself but i feel sick and i just want to lay around and forget my own existence.I don't want to die but i wish i would have never existed to begin with since it would be more easier for everyone i know.Maybe you guys can understand. I don't want to talk about it with anyone i know.
