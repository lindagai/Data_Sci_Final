Okay so I've had my fair share of being depressed and the good ol crippling anxiety and talking about my "feelings" to friends and of course the people I have to pay to talk to. I don't know therapy is dumb and I feel like I never get anything out of it and it's like it always makes me feel worse afterwards because anyone I've seen about it brings up shit at the most inconvenient times and never helps me get over those things and it's like what's the point of it? And also I've been in the mind set for quite some time now where I constantly think about dying and ways to kill myself but that's just the depression talking and then the anxiety kicks in and tells me all of the bad things that would happen after I kill myself even though I'll be dead and it won't matter to me because I'm dead. And it's like I'm not scared to die and I really wouldn't mind it but at the same time I'm too much of a pussy to kill myself. It's like I think about the sweet release of death but it's the minutes or seconds leading up to that point that scare me and make me not want to. It's like if I hang my self what is it gonna be like leading up to the point where I die? Or if I get hit by a car in oncoming traffic. Or if I take too many pills. Or anything really. I don't know. And I'm the type of person who always makes sarcastic jokes about killing myself or suicide but it's like I don't know if I'd actually do it or not. It's just something always wandering in the back of my mind.
