I was diagnosed with major depression a few years back after my most serious suicide attempt. But I can't help but still feel that way even now. They tried putting me on medications and in counselling but I'm not doing any of that now. Plus, my parents do foster care so I don't have the ability to talk to them when I need to... they're always busy with something else. I don't want counseling anyway. Right now I just want to go to a phycological hospital. I desperately crave white walls with no noise right now. I just want to be alone and rot away. I want to die so badly but every time that attempt it I think about something that makes me stop. But every time I wake up I feel even worse... why can't I just vanish...
