You're not alone in your feelings. I grew up believing in a god too, but due to circumstances in my life I don't believe in a god, nor do I want too. I look around and I see some of the worst human beings imaginable have everything and others have absolutely nothing. I'm positive that there's no god, but if there was fuck him. Fuck god.
