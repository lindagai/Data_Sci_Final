I've been depressed all my life. I'm depressed for a lot of reasons. I have these 'memories' in my head, for literally as long as I can remember. Very painful and extremely confusing memories, if they even ARE memories. Whenever I tried to seek help and talk about them, I was only met with ridicule or simply called a troll. I tried to ask for help using different accounts or on different sites, but those same people followed me. I wish I could say I don't have these memories but I do and they haunt me. I feel like I'm living in two different worlds and it is so confusing. I think about it every day of my life but I'm too scared to even talk about it to my parents. It's 1:30 AM here and I don't know what to do. I just tried to cut my throat and it is bleeding some but I chickened out from the pain to fully cut my throat, now I'm freaking out about having to explain the cut to my mother tomorrow.
