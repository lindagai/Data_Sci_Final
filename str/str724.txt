When I am at my lowest one othe things that I do the most is try and talk to other people about it. The problem is that I don't really don't talk, I just complain and try to take them down with me. I write notes and show them to them, I threated to kill myself, I ask awful questions attacking their attempts to cheer me up and genreraly be an awful person. I always say that I don't want help anymore, but I always seek out others when I am low. I guess I dont want help but I want companionship, I can't cheer myself up long enough to get close to people so I try and depress them to bring them to my level. I never really thought about this until now and I am horrified about how awful I am. I can't believe that I am such a monster, I ruin others day for my own selfish needs, I can't live with myself anymore. I don't deserve to live anymore.
