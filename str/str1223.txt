Try to keep in mind why you're doing it in the first place.  Learning has inherent value, so even if you aren't going to be teaching math, its still beneficial to know it.  And at least for myself, there is extra satisfaction that comes out of understanding a concept in math that you've been struggling with (I am definitely not good at math so I get where you're coming from). Maybe try to use this experience as a teacher in the future.  Some of your students may feel the same way about social studies, it can be useful to remember how you feel now when trying to help them succeed. That being said, it sounds like you're just stressed/worried, not depressed so hopefully once you've taken your test that feeling will go away.
