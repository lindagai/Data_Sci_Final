My quality at work has fallen off a cliff like it never has before.I think being dead would be much better than continuing on.I feel like my IQ has dropped.I have zero interest in almost anything at all. I feel guilty that people in my life are having to prop me up and deal with my mistakes... at work I feel it could lead to me getting fired in the near future.Fucking hell!
