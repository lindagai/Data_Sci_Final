Hey I made an account just to post this, it's taken me about a week to get enough motivation to even do so.  It's my birthday tomorrow and I'm not excited or happy about it at all, I'll probably be more upset tomorrow then I will today. I don't even want to leave my room, I feel almost fearful of doing so but it's not quite that either.  I feel sick, and I feel like throwing up. For the first time I've actually done self-harm. It's not even that much since I'm afraid of pain, but I've run scissors over my arms, almost breaking skin. I feel like a wuss for not actually cutting fully. I think I did this partially since everyone thinks that I can't be depressed without trying to kill myself (even though everyday for the last 5 years I wake up and think "I should kill myself today") or do self-harm (and I've thought about it quite a bit).I have no motivation to do anything or even talk to someone. I had alot of things to say on this post but my head feels heavy and foggy, I've forgotten what I wanted to say.  I don't even think posting about this is going to make me feel better even, talking about it has never, ever made me feel better (it usually makes it worse).I don't know.
