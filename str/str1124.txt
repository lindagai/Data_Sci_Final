about fifteen/twenty minutes ago I had a horrible fucking crippling anxiety/existential crisis attack, so bad that I have bite marks all over my hand cause it was the only thing I could do to stop myself from not keeling over. does anyone have any experience with this and how do you help numb its effect on you. the last few days I've had so many of these: a sudden  out of body moment where I remember that I'm going to die one day and everything goes dizzy, my throat closes up and I feel like I'm going to faint. my current technique is either to hurt myself to find a physical pain that overrules the emotional one, or to scream something in my head in the hopes that I'll drown it out. all seems futile. please help.edit: I don't have anyone family or friends wise to talk to so please don't recommend that as it'll be pointless.
