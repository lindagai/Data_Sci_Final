Hello. Throwaway account. Thanks for taking the time to read what I gotta say. Any advice will be greatly appreciated. Here goes..Im 24, and to all those around me, i seem happy, confident and relaxed. However, inside I'm a total mess. Every few minutes thoughts will pop in to my head like little bubbles, saying 'I should kill myself' or 'I hate myself'. I used to just shrug these off, as for the most part I didn't actually think this way, at all. The thoughts would only happen when I was stressed out. Now, they're pretty constant, and I'm not sure I can shrug them off as easily.I was in an emotionally and physically abusive relationship a few years back and haven't been in a stable one since. The past few years I've been trying really hard to learn to love myself, and haven't been very active in the dating game because of this. However, I am feeling very lonely, and feel that being alone is crushing my self confidence further. How do I date when I hate myself? Should I? I'm finding it hard to even leave the house when I'm not working. I honestly feel close to hurting myself, although I haven't in a really long time.
