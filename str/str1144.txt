Hello everyone. I have an upcoming appointment with my doctor (yearly physical). I have never been diagnosed with anxiety, but I want to ask my doctor if I could get a prescription for Propranolol. My anxiety is triggered when I think about the symptoms such as racing heart, red face, shaking. I basically get panick attacks when I'm put on the spot because I get anxious of how I will look. I can interact with people, but dealing with a racing heart and a red face is what I dread. I know Propranolol works for me because I have tried them even without a prescription (I know, not the smartest idea), but this is why I want to ask my doc for a prescirption. They help me a lot by keeping me calm, but I just don't know how to approach my doc about this. Any advice will be appreaciated, thank you.
