You shouldn't have to explain what's going on with you, and somebody who'd make a good friend would respect that.One way to go about making online friends is to find a group of people who share a similar interest. There are groups for literally every hobby in existence.And, if nothing else, sometimes just feeling comfortable enough with somebody that you type them a long response...that's not a bad way to strike up a friendship. :)
