Sorry, if this sounds melodramatic.I can't take it. The thoughts, the worsening cough, the constant noises, it's chipping into my head. The mask of sanity is wearing off, it's becoming real difficult acting like everything is fine, when I'm just itching to die now. None of the knives in the house are sharp enough for real damage, either too small or too dull. No high places or a sturdy rope. Knowing my luck, this body will withstand against a traffic collision and make my situation even worse. This is no longer a want, I NEED to die. Years now, literally years, this has been going, with that stupid and shitty constant saying that "things will always be better"I HATE the people who said that.Things have only gotten WORSE. On the brink of insanity. Will likely become homeless soon. I'm pretty sure I'm on my way to a collapsed lung that no doctor will give a shit about. As said before, it's becoming real difficult keeping my demeanor. Love? The fuck is that?No more, fucking hate this. Hate it, I hate it. I want it done, gone. I can't even sleep anymore, and when I do, it's just dreams of lives that I don't have and won't have. I can't live like this no more, it's now a fucking desperation. Need to buy a gun. Fast as possible. With good ammunition. If you know anyway, PM me the information.
