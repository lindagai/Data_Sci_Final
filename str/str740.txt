Hey! I am sorry.. I can not write good sentences today.. I am just too tired and out of energy.. I try to describe everything as best as possible. Here is my situation:-M / 23 / german I tried to end it all when I was 19 --&gt; 2 weeks in a mental hospital which did not really help me but opened my eyes about suicideAfter that saw a psychologist  for half a year.. she was awefull. Had to start over and over again every week.. she did not even remember my name sometimes.  (she got paid by my health insurance)I told her my opinion about her and never came back. Then I  found a psychologist from the USA who lived in germany. Saw him every week for over a year and it felt really good. He cared about me. I had to pay him on my own tho. One day he told me that he would move far away. Everything ended in one day. he told me (via email) that our "work" is over  and that I should look for another psychologist. This hurt so much.. I never looked for another one because i feared the next bad experience to come. I went to my doctor a few weeks after that and she got me antidepressants. I took 4 different antidepressants over a time of 1 year and nothing worked. I felt no change at all. Nothing..Here I am now.. No one to talk to, no working medication, no "real life" friends.. nothing..I have no idea why I even wrote this.  I just had to get it of my chest.
