Well, I saw my mental counselor today. Talked with him and thought things were going to actually get better today. Come home to find she returned everything. No note. I don't know what to do. I haven't moved from where I opened it. I want to cry, I want to die. I want to scream, I want to talk to her. I just...I can't exist right now. Guess who isn't sleeping tonight...anyone want to talk? Please.
