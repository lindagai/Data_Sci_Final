I've started drinking before work. I hate my job. It's not that it is terrible persay, but I never see my SO other than weekends, and half the time he is out with his friends, because God forbid they aren't constantly doing something together whether it be gaming, fishing, hanging out,  usually drinking, whatever. I pretty much get the shit end of the stick. I hate being on call when it's my turn. I don't handle stress well. I've applied to other jobs, but I have the resume of an ultra job hopper. This is the longest I've held a job and that has only been a year now. I get bored too easily. I'm depressed. I think the hormones I'm on are making me suicidal. I had been stable for the most part until a couple weeks after I started them and now all I want is to get hit by a car and die or just somehow drop dead.The only time lately that I am not pretty much actively thinking about how I can kill myself, is when I have booze in me. Hence the drinking before work. It's not a ton, but a couple beers that I end up a tad buzzed walking in the door. Not drunk, but not sober either. I don't know how to deal with life. I should be using my DBT skills, and my therapist is trying to help me find positives to build up so I don't feel so hopeless, but nothing really seems to work. I'm just sick of life. I'm sick of wanting to make something of myself but I don't know wtf to do with my life. I was supposed to be part way through med school by now like my classmates, but I am too scared of failing. Failing the mcat, failing med school, and being an overall fuck up. Which is what I am. I don't even know who I am anymore.
