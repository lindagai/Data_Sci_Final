Happy belated birthday!Don't worry about the sex. Today's society places pressure on kids and young adults to have sex. You'll eventually find the right person. My husband was in his late twenties when he first had sex...with me his only long term girlfriend.I never found it odd and actually found it admirable that he wasn't the type of guy who actively sought out sex. I've dealt with depression for the majority of my life and the only thing I can really say on that is to exercise and possibly try medication. I don't want to be a pusher when it comes to meds because I know some individuals prefer to overcome their depression using other means but medication for me has been a lifesaver. Edit - I also didn't learn how to drive until I was 21 as well. I was late on doing many things in life.
