Hey everyone -- I'm prescribed 30 mg of Vyvanse to treat my ADHD. I noticed it effects me in a more proactive way: I don't procrastinate, I'm - for the most part - more focused and my mood seems to be more regulated, so I'm less sensitive. Although, I do get irritable on occasion when taking it. Recently I've undergone a lot of stress with school and work. I've noticed my anxiety has shot through the roof. I'm a journalist, and did a live report two weeks ago when it got really bad. My palms were sweating profusely, my heart was racing and I got a horrible taste in my mouth. I'm sure Vyvanse exacerbated my existent anxiety, but . . . that can't be happening. I have some great opportunities coming up, and I can't let this get in the way of my professional aspirations. Are any of you who suffer similar symptoms on a specific medicine, or combination? I tried Strattera, and it made me feel like a zombie, null off creativity and suicidal. Needless to say, I also want to avoid those feelings.
