So recently I have had a tremendous surge of confidence, and everything seems to be going alright. This always scares me though, because whenever I have a huge boost in confidence, an equally huge wave of depression follows. Does this happen to anyone else? I'm always afraid that I will commit suicide due to these waves of depression, and I feel like I am about to hit the biggest one yet. Your thoughts are appreciated. :)
