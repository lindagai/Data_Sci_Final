Hey there guys. I feel empty. I always try to tell myself that I will change but always ends up in the same havits where I wake up every morning, feeling heavy and not wanting to get up. Only video games, animes, and funny online things makes my brain be active and makes me feel at ease. Whenever I don't do any of those things I feel empty, shitty, or down. I always space out for no apparent reason. I don't want to connect with people anymore. In fact I don't care about anyone anymore. I try to think of my what my dreams are but I just end up with nothing. Everday feels like a burden. I can't cry anymore. I don't know what to do with my life anymore. Most of the time I just wish that I'll suddenly disappear. I want to kill myself but I whenever I think so I feel afraid for my parents, my sister and my girlfriend. The only thing I genuinely want right now is for me to die of natural causes or accidents. sorry if this is a long rant. I just wanted to share it with people who might understand what I'm going through and not just dismiss it as laziness or tell me that it's just all in my head and that if I change my view of life it will get better. Thank you for taking your time to read this.
