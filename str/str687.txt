I used to take Wellbutrin, but I stopped about 8 months ago, because I'm a dumbass. I've majorly fucked up my life, and I just want it all to end.In February, I started my second semester of my sophomore year of college. I found myself becoming increasingly anxious every time I went to class. (This happens whenever I'm in a public place that I can't easily leave, like a subway car.) I felt shaky and panicked, and I became paranoid that people were staring at me. No matter how hard I tried to push through and control it, nothing worked. Around March, I started skipping class, and by April I stopped going altogether. I kept trying to force myself to go, but I just couldn't. I didn't withdraw or drop the classes. I just disappeared. I know I failed the whole semester. It's absolutely going to kill my GPA, and I'll probably lose my scholarship and get kicked out of my selective program. I was already on academic probation. I'm screwed. My parents have no idea what's going on, and I feel so damn guilty. I hate myself.I'm past the point of even wanting to fix my life. I don't want to go to treatment or finish my degree. I don't want to to get a job or get married or start a family. I don't want to exist at all. I seriously can't imagine living for another 60-65 years. I can barely get through the day.If my parents weren't in my life, I'd kill myself right now. I think about it constantly, and it seems like the only way out. However, my death would probably destroy my mom. I really don't want to hurt her. But I know can't live either. I'm trapped.I feel like my brain is paralyzed. I literally cannot do anything. Someone please just tell me what to do.**TL;DR**- I fucked up at school and I feel like killing myself. I don't want to hurt my parents, but I don't want to live either.
