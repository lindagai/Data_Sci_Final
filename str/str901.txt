I just can't take it at work. I have no idea what to do. I got the quickest doctor appointment I could but he is shit (if we listened to him my dad would have died). He said he didn't want to up my citalopram (I'm only on 20mg) because I'm small.. Wtf.. I'm 5ft1. He said he could give me a course of CBT, but I've already completed one and it literally did nothing for me. So he changed me onto prozac and said there's nothing else he can do!!? Like ok ill just kill myself then üëçMy cutting is bad again too and my hr told my shop floor manager  :/I also don't know if I'm happy in my relationship anymore. Even though he is lovely..I have  NO IDEA what to do. Carry on wanting to die and breaking down every day.. Everyday seems impossible. Also im such a loser and have no friends and my hr is the only person I talk toThank you if you read this
