I've been living with depression for about 2 years now. It started out as slight and has continually grown as struggles in my marriage have gone unresolved for the same amount of time. Up until about 9 months ago it was bearable, but then I could tell that a deep dark depression was starting to creep in. As I suspected, it has crept in and made its dark, dreary, foreboding home in my mind and body. It's to the point now that I feel like I'm a mindless zombie putting one foot in front of the other day after day just because that's what I'm \"supposed to do\".Some might say that since this is related to my marriage that my wife and I need to just get some marriage counseling. Been there, done that. She goes but it's only because I want to. She doesn't believe in individual or marital therapy. We've tried 2 or 3 different therapists and gone on an intensive marriage retreat weekend that my parents and others found very useful. It did nothing lasting for us. Wife didn't want to do the \"homework\" that was required to make the process work, and so it died.I'm taking Wellbutrin, and I'm hopeful that I'll find a therapist I can connect with soon. (That has been a challenge for me since moving here to another state 4 1/2 years ago.) I have an appointment with a new therapist this coming Friday morning. We'll see what happens.I feel a lot of despair around having a marriage that I doubt will ever be able to be a happy one. I feel guilt about having an only child. I was an only child and promised myself that no matter what I would never have a child and leave it alone in this world like I was. I broke that promise, and I see the fruits of that played out a lot lately in my 3rd grade daughter's life. The guilt is overwhelming.So there you have it. At least I finally shared some of my story with someone besides myself. Maybe this will be the beginning of me opening up more which I desperately need to do.Thanks for reading.
