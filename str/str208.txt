Behaviorist is much better than standard psychology/psychiatry.  It is more working on yourself and fixing yourself.    If someone need pills to exist then he is in bad state. Taking meds is make you weaker. They are not fixing the problem and you live in fake assumption that you are fighting with depression.  (Sometimes meds are good if you have hypothyroidsm altough is good to knew how to deal with depression even without meds . Embrace anxiety)
