So did you have any plans before dropping out? Like what you'd want to do and stuff. I'm considering dropping out but i hear that you need plans A B and C- if Plan A fails then b then c etc. but ofc thats the hard part. I guess we are on the same boat here since I have no idea what I want to do. Everything seems like a lost cause to me atm. Bipolar is when you have these sudden jolts of uplifting in the sense of feelings/ abilities to think/ work / produce. Your capability just arises to amazingly high levels that you never experienced before.You may feel euphoric joy- you want to cry because everything is so beautiful. I have had these moments for a long time and it really feels like a clip in the movies or a fantasy novel where you suffocate from extreme joy. Of course it is not a positive sign.Then I would experience the same level of feeling/ capability and etc. but this time on the other end of the spectrum. Lethargy, hopelessness, extreme fatigue, depressive thoughts may lead you to extreme situations where you know may happen to extremely depressed people. I hate this fucked up routine of mine and ive been trying a lot if ways in which i could cope with these without the help of medicine- i personally felt like medicine gave me a 'false' sense of happiness and thus  it always felt like there was a fog in my brain.
