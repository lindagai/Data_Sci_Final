I've always been making up stories to make me "feel better".Maybe my life is a test made in the future to toughen up soilders or what ever, because sometimes I lose it all. All morals all hope, I feel like I could do anything because after I do it I'll be dead. Reminds me of how I nearly broke my leg after jumping 4m+ on a swing on a bad day.
