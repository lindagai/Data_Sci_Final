I moved out of my parents' home last week. I no longer felt safe at home. I love my parents but the constant screaming matches we got into were taking a toll on me. And I knew all too well how to hurt myself in that house. If I could, I'd break myself apart until there was nothing left. I know how to hide blades in my room, and I know my parents won't check my arms for cuts or bruises or burns. I had to leave...I would have killed myself if I had stayed. Last week I moved in with my boyfriend and his family. I still think about hurting myself and dying, but I have a good support system here. His mom works with kids with mental health issues, she knows all the right things to say and how to tell if I'm self harming. My boyfriend is always there for me, and when you've got someone you love to hold you, the urge to cut isn't so bad.The way I've been trying to justify this move is with an inpatient scenario. I was in the ER because I tried to kill myself. I know inpatient programs at hospitals are sometimes an option for people in my situation. It's a safe environment, with support readily available in the form of nurses and dr's. I know it sounds silly, but this is my recovery program. This is my safe place with support. Is that so wrong? According to my parents, yes it is.I'm on waitlists for programs, I've got intake appointments, and have been through 2 types of meds at the highest doses already. The only support I can access is walk in counselling sessions or the emergency room. I don't know, maybe I am being stupid but I do feel less suicidal...until my parents call me to give me a hard time or beg me to come home. I'm sorry if you read all of this...I needed to vent because this has all been so very stressful.
