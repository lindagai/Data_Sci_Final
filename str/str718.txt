I have 19 years, but I feel like I lived long enough(i don't feel old).I don't see a future, life is not exciting.I wish I lived in a dofferent world, like Star Wars, Middleearth, Harry Potter's world etc.I can't imagine working in some boeing stuff until late sixties.I just can't find myself a place in the world.I am angry that I was born.It is not, that I am depressed etc, this world simply isn't enjoyable place for me.I don't want to stay alive.
