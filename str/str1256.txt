I can't tell you how much this meant to me. I can only hope that you find the answers you need. A hope that none of us carry for ourselves. I can't tell you it'll get better. I can't tell you you'll find happiness. I can't you these emotions will go away. I can only tell you that you're not alone in your wishes and thoughts. I can only hope your life improves my dear. Thank you for sharing! Thank you from the bottom of my black heart for sharing.
