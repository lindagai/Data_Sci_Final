I've done everything I can to not be worthless, I've tried everything and I just can't do any of it. You have any idea how painful it is when anytime you try and do anything someone tells you it's \"the worst attempt they've ever seen\" or that they're sure there's something else you can do (hint; there isn't, trust me I've tried).I'm not trying to force anything, I'm just trying to be decent enough to not live an objectively shitty life, and I can't. There's absolutely nothing I can do about it. Because I've done everything.I saw a dietician and a personal trainer for years, I've tried to find anything I'm not objectively terrible at that I might be able to enjoy and I couldn't do that either. Seriously, I'm just begging anyone for help with anything that I might be able to do and I can't, at all.And no, I'm not good enough for me, I've only ever faced rejection, how the fuck am I supposed to think I can be okay when more people have told me to kill myself than tell me I'm a decent person?
