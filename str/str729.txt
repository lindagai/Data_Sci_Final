I feel like no one will read this but I wish I could just kill myself. I see nothing of worth in life, I haven't accomplished anything. Crippled by anxiety and depression, I had to drop out of university, the one thing I had always dreamt of achieving was gone. As a child, I was molested by a relative and I had kept it hidden for so long. Now I live everyday of my life affected by it. I feel so disgusted by myself, I feel so worthless. Today I had an argument with a sibling who told me that all I do is sit at home all day with no contribution to anything. I thought they were wrong but maybe it's true, I don't give out anything, I try and help my parents but with no job and no money, it's hard. I am rambling so much but I feel so alone, my boyfriend thinks I'm joking when I say I want to kill myself but I'm not. More than anything I wish a car would run me over or something but I barely even leave the house anymore for that to happen. I wish there was an end to all this, I just don't see the point in life anymore, Im so shit at life! There's no point in me being alive at all.EDIT: Thank you everyone for the lovely words, I think I was just going through a very rough day and I'm glad I came out of the other side of that having done nothing with my urges t end my life. Sometimes depression really makes you think of doing the extreme to get out of rough patch but we have to try and remember that these feelings will pass, even if it happens again, I know it's just temporary and I can fight through it!!
