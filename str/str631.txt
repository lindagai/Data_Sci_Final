Looking back I started making progress well before I went into therapy, i.e. the fact that I went into a therapy was a sign that I was improving. When I was in therapy looking back I was still slowly making progress since day one even though it certainly didn't seem like so at the time. It got better and worse all the time and I experienced some huge setbacks and did many stupid things, so at some points I felt like I was still at square one, even though looking back the trend is a slow upward climb. Kind of reminds me of [this stupid inspirational image](http://madeyemaryann.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/success.png).Right now I think I'm close to a stable pleasant mood even though I have to admit that it seems like medication helps a ton in this, so there's still a lot of work to do. I also recently got another therapist (I left therapy some time ago, for various reasons, some rational some not) so I'm somewhat hopeful that I will be able to reach a stable baseline soon, considering that I have been on and off depressed for a good 5 years.
