Final year of high school,  usually an amazing and memorable year for everyone,  expect for me. I'm lonely,  I want to just talk to someone about stuff but no one acknowledges me.  No one cares about me. I'm always alone and it's killing me.  I have no friends except a few online who just make fun of me.  It's unfair, I'm always looking out for people and don't expect anything but yet I'm always forgotten. No one invites me to anywhere even asking some people if they want to go swimming or something and they just reply that they're busy and an hour later complain of being bored. This loneliness is severely taking a toll on me and no one cares because I'm forgettable.  I wasn't always like this.... 2 years ago I was one of the most popular students within the school and had the best grades.  Then I had a horrible rumour spread about me that turned everyone against me despite there being proof that the rumours where false. Everyone has turned their backs on me and now I just want to end it. What's the point anyways?  I wanted to get into medical school and because of one stupid grade I've been rejected.  My last option was travelling abroad but why should I put the huge loans on me and my already financially broke family?  I have no one and nothing left to give this world anyways,  why should I continue?  I've done all I can and nothing helps am just a ghost in people's eyes.  All I want is a cure to my lonelyness just a normal conversation just anything to stop me being this way. What have I done to anyone that makes them hate me?  I'm always helping people yet they're just using me and we both know it. People look at me in disgust and I don't know why.  I beg them for an answer but they just look at me weird and ignore me.  Please help me
