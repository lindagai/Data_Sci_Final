I generally have seasonal depression, especially in the winter (SAD, vitamin d deficiency, etc), but every once in a while, especially if I'm inside quite a bit during rainy weeks or don't get any exercise (sports injury) I get pretty down. PTSD of some form.Anyway, it occurred to me that I struggle with playing too much computer games. I'm not a child, I'm married with kids, but I use them as an escape. At least I don't get drunk and beat my wife, right? Well, better for whom? Right now it looks like I don't care about anyone. I'd rather be with imaginary people. The only time I'm truly happy is when I'm meditating (zazen) or immersed in a TV show or game so deeply that the world around me ceases to exist.Anyone else experience anything like this? I'm talking drug-free but not-quite-sober? Some people binge Neflix or read a lot or maybe workoholics? Makes it sound like an existential crisis, but it's not, it's depression and lots of things function as an escape, not just drugs.Maybe I'll go download Skyrim and get lost for a while. I'll check back here later...
