&gt; I think one of the main issues with depression, or at least in my experiences, is our inability to forgive ourselves and cut ourselves some slack.This, so much. I might have created plans for the following day, to be productive, but when I end up not doing it, it makes me so much more depressed. It's like an endless cycle.
