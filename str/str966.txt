I hurt my girlfriend for the last 3 years and I feel so shitty about it. She left me 2 weeks ago and I don't blame her at all but I can't live without her. She's on to other things and wants nothing to do with me. It's so hard to do anything. I haven't eaten in 3 days. I don't feel hungry. I just feel hatred for myself. I don't want to hurt anybody ever again. Nobody understands how bad I want her back. I know I deserve all of what's happening to me but I just can't live with it. The only reason I haven't pulled the trigger is because I don't want to hurt her anymore. I don't want to hurt my parents and my family but I don't want to be here anymore. Please help me.
