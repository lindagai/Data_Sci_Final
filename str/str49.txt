I know its hard in those circumstances Maybe pulling him aside and opening to him and just saying what your going through. If one of my staff mebers opened upto me personally id be suprised and shocked but id have a new respect and understanding for the person. Friends come and go alot of the time but respect is something diffrent. Its a suggestion and if it doesnt sit well hopefully it gets the ball rolling. Hope it helped
