It's been four months. The heartache is still as fresh as it was from day 1 of the breakup. Got my medical card on my birthday about 3 weeks ago and I have just been high, drunk, or a combination of both a majority of the time because when I'm sober, she's all I dream and think about. Hell even still, lately the sadness and heartbreak are overwhelming my high. I'm broken, just living in the past.But she's not coming back to me. She's moved on. Her sisters have welcomed him as nicely as they welcomed me over 5 years ago. Her life goes on, despite her telling me months ago that it was just a break, that she wanted to get back together eventually. I can't stand the thought of her being with someone else. Caring for her. Being intimate. I've pushed away everyone who ever considered themselves my friend. For a while I tried keeping friends, but I knew it wasn't helping. They felt obligated to show supportive words and gestures but when it came down to it, I really was alone. So now I have nobody.I'm depressed, lonely, live in the past, and apparently do not know how to cope with how my life has turned out. I have not, even after all this time, found a job yet that would provide me sufficient income to be able to pay for my death, and I'm beginning to think I will never be employed again due to my credit failing, being fired from my previous job (and the circumstances surrounding it) and I don't know if I should even wait anymore.I want to die, but I also want to want to be happy. You should have killed me instead of breaking my heart like this. I'm a broken man, now, and the panic attacks whenever I remember how alone I am are getting worse. I can't live like this. I don't want to live like this.
