I have taken this for 10 months at around 3 pills 375mg each. I got a raise at work and the negative thoughts went away. I am also in the best shape of my life. I was feeling amazing. I wanted to see how I would be off of it I slowly weaned off. I am seeing a therapist now. I would drop off a pill every month. I was on 2 pills a day and started dating a girl. Things are great. I am on no other anti depressants. I liked the natural option. I then went from two pills and then to 1. I live in Sweden and went to the US to visit my family. I stopped taking them 6 days ago. 4 days later I started to feel worse. I am starting to fear losing the girl I have been with for 5weeks. Since I am away from here for 4 weeks and it is new. There is no reason for this. She seems to be really into me. When I was on 2 pills at the time we met. I still had thoughts of rejection, but I went with the flow. I am starting to over analyze everything. The St. Johns Wort took away 90 percent of my anxiety. I decided yesterday I don't want to live this way and then this medication really helps. I'm not sure what the long term damage is, but I feel it's safer then anxiety medication and I am not on any other medications. I don't want to loose a relationship with someone because of me being my worst enemy again. The only side effect I get is light sensitivity. It takes some time to build back up in your system. I took 6 pills yesterday 5 today and my plan is to take 4 tomorrow and then stick at 3 the rest of the month. Does this sound like a reasonable plan to get it working faster? I Skype with my girl Thursday and want to stop the nonsense in my head.
