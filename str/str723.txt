I don't exactly feel comfortable trying to diagnose someone like this, but I've been getting increasingly frustrated with her erratic behaviour lately. Then I started reading about people with bipolar doing the exact same thing as she does and I'm wondering if she could have it.She is a very emotional person and has extreme mood swings. One minute she seems like a total extrovert and wants to socialize and go out and party. Then all of a sudden, she switches and becomes very reclusive, cold and unapproachable. She can obsess over the smallest things and make a drama out of anything. This has become even more evident since she joined Facebook. One day she's chatting to everybody, sharing the smallest details of her day (e.g. "OMG I just ate the best donut ever!!!"... and then she'll be posting photos and updates about her donut for the entire day). The next day she'll be snappy and rude and will be saying things like "why is the world against me? i hate my life, i want to die" etc.In real life, she's just as up and down. One minute she's texting all of her friends, planning parties and then a few days later she'll cancel and switch off her phone so no one can reach her. Sometimes she goes into a really depressed state and starts having a panic attack. The amount of times she's cancelled plans because she's not feeling up to it on the day is uncountable. This has been happening pretty much every week for the last 7 years of knowing her. I've always thought it was just her character but it happens so often that it must be something deeper. Just before I met her, her mother died so maybe that has something to do with it?I don't know. Am I clutching at straws here or am I on to something?
