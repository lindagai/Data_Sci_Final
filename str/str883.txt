I don't have the will do kill myself or to do anything in general. Last time I tried was through adderal and ended with going through a seizure and migraines. Not a good idea. Im depressed and I dont know why. I dont talk to my friends at school anymore. I have withdrawn myself and finals are coming but I cant study. I cant do anything. I feel drained, I want someone else to kill me, someone else to fight me. I want to fight someone. I want pain but am too much of a wimp to hurt myself. I'm hurting inside but no one notices or cares. Everyone around me is happy but for me. Its sad, its selfish but it wont go away.
