He was my best friend in high school but for around four years we grew apart simply because I pushed everyone away due to my poor mental health. He deleted me off Facebook but added me on Xbox Live recently so just now, I sent him three full 255 character messages on my Xbox One explaining why I have been a complete asshole and treated him like shit. I said there's something I should have told him years ago. I suffer from depression. I even said how I had to leave my job as I was having regular breakdowns and crying. I can't fix the past but I don't want to live with regret. He was the best friend I ever had and I won't let a mental illness make me lose that.It was quite emotional typing it all out. He's only the second person I've told besides my mum and that's how close and how much trust I have in him. I don't know if he will forgive me but it feels like a massive weight has been lifted from my shoulders. I feel liberated.I can't beat this monster alone. I still have my dark days but I like to believe I am getting better. I need someone like him with me and not against me. Don't be scared in opening up to people or you will lose them.
