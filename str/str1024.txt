I was on my way to a store to buy a keyboard (bec the one I use just broke) and I thought I could just end it there. I was about to dive in when a stranger pulled me by my shirt and I just started crying uncontrollably. I thought it wasn't obvious that I was about dive in front of the oncoming train. Then the guy gave me a hug while I was crying and snot dripping down my nose. I don't know whether to thank him or be angry at him, but I just told him that he should go bec I don't want him to miss the train. I'm filled with so much guilt rn and I can't tell anybody in my home about what happened today. Edit: I didn't think anybody would be able to read this. Thank you for all the kind words. I am doing a lot better now than I did earlier today. Edit2: I am overwhelmed by all the kind words from everybody (but I still have this feeling that I don't deserve any of it.) I just now realized how big of an inconvenience I would have been if nobody was there to pull me back. I didn't come back home until just now, and rn I just want a whole pot of tea and a good sleep. Again, thank you to everybody who read this
