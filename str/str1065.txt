I got dumped about 3 months ago. The girl and I still spent all our time together, we never got "back together". We were together, minus the title. The relationship was really abusive. Physical from her end, emotional from mine. I had a big giant meltdown and I didn't talk to her for a few days. In that time, I go see a doctor and get put on bupropion and propranolol. I decide I wasn't making her happy because I wasn't happy. Yea, she was abusive, but so was I and we weren't on the same page emotionally. I was tired of living like a depressed piece of shit and decided that I needed to get in the mindset of not everything being terrible. I want to be happy and make my girlfriend happy and work through our problems like adults. Not me crying or storming off.Life sucks a lot right now, but only because I'm letting it. I try so hard to keep my head up. I had become addicted to depression and I quit it cold-turkey. Today, my brain wasn't having it. I woke up exhausted, with a headache, and feeling drained. All the thoughts I had been trying to fight came rushing back in. I feel so alone in the world. I don't have any friends where I'm at. I moved here with my ex-girlfriend and never spent time trying to make friends because it was all dedicated to her. I feel like I'll never make friends because I don't know how to talk to people. I'm not very fun or funny. I'm cynical and critical and get uncomfortable really fast. I'm doing terrible in school, mainly due to said girlfriend always belittling me and telling me how stupid and lazy I was. I started to believe it and stopped caring about school. Now I have a terrible GPA and it's just kind of a vicious cycle.I know it's probably for the best that we're done, but I've never felt so bad about anything. I've had girlfriends and breakups, but I've never felt so empty and beyond repair.
