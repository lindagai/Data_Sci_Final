I have every opportunity to make my life more worth living. I have people who still want to spend time with me even though I've pushed the majority of people far away from me. I have a job that looks like it could be a great career if I try harder. But every night I come home and go to bed at 7pm and just stare at my phone. Every weekend I stay in bed and try to take as many meds as possible to numb me out. I live in a city with so much to do but I refuse to get out. I panic and cry and stay in bed alone. Very few people bother to text me anymore. I think about suicide constantly. I wish I could buy some meds for assisted suicide. I'm a waste of space and a waste of time. Anyone else could have done so much better with what I have than me. Fuck myself. I can't wait to die.
