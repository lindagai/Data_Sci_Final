I've been to two counselors who told me that I should try medication, but when I've told friends and family about it they answer with "you're just being dramatic" or "stop feeling sorry about yourself." I'm actually doubting it now, because there are days when I can have fun with the friend I have, or genuinely feel good when I do something with my family. However, this is usually marred by zero self confidence and complete hopelessness. I probably hang out with my friend twice a week and at those times I can laugh and be happy. When I'm at home with my family, I can laugh at something on the computer.I can enjoy watching movies or tv shows. But there are times when I feel this dark cloud where nothign feels like it will every be okay, so why don't I just kill myself because I'm so bad at everything and no one likes me. I also get intrusive thoughts, which bother me but I've never told anyone about them. But I can still smile and talk with family/friends. Is it possible to be able to function enough to give off the facade of being okay while having depression? Or with depression would someone else have noticed something is wrong by now? I'm still able to get out of bed everyday, but my thoughts are constantly negative and hurtful.
