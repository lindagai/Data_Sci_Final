The only reason I havent killed myself is the pain it would cause my family and friends. I dont want to hurt them. I dont want to do anything hurtful ever again. I dont want to exist. But to do that, I have to hurt others. Does the same principle apply? Should I stay in this relationship of life just to please others when I am not happy, havent been for years, and dont see a point when I will be happy?
