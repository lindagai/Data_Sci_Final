You are certainly not alone in having "casual" suicidal thoughts, and I agree with you; once you halt for a moment and think about it, it's rather messed up. Although it's most likely very common, maybe even completely natural, in my mind it tells something about the human condition.There's so many people suffering from depression, be it the result of some kind of social pressure to become someone "great", or a natural consequence of being so cut off from our natural origins, or simply mental unwellness; either it tells that society is messed up, you as an individual is messed up, or that the mere existence as a human being is totally messed up.I don't know where I'm going with this. However, it's these kinds of thoughts that tend to come to mind when I have these "casual" suicidal thoughts. Maybe it's just me trying to explain why they happen in an attempt to cope with the fact that I do have them. Like making it seem so normal that it's not worth paying any attention to.Regardless, I had a childhood friend that committed suicide not too long ago. It broke my heart, and nowadays I feel guilty every time I think about death in this manner. I can't help it when the thoughts just come to mind at random, but his death has certainly made me get very angry, or disappointed with myself when it happens.I think I'll go for a walk in the sunlight now.
