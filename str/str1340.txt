I want to die. I don't know how to talk to people. I have chronic pain (physical and emotional).I cannot work.A disability attorney told me it will take ~15 months for me to start receiving payments.I don't know what to do.I am a financial and emotional burden on my family. I can't sleep.I don't know what it feels like to be ok.I'm so tired.I don't know what to do.I've tried at least 20 different medications. Nothing has helped (in fact, I think this current one might be making me feel worse). Weekly therapy sessions are not enough. I don't know what I need.I'm broken. Mind, body, and heart.I guess that's it for now.
