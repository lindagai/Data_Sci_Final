I try to cover as many posts as I can when I'm feeling well enough. Always makes me feel bad to see a post without any comments. Wish I had more advice to offer though. Your situation just isn't something I'm experienced with. Then again, I've known isolation a lot throughout my life. So I take it back, in just not experienced in solving the problem. I guess I got lucky when I found a group to hang out with but I question whether they even like me being around. They claim they do, and sometimes show concern but they argue with me a lot so... Really hope a solution just comes your way.
