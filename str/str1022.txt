I f*cking hate the fact that people see me as inferior and stupid because I had to drop out of sixth form (a college-level thing before uni). I feel so worthless I want to just die every day. My self worth &amp; sense of identity is dependent on and based on academic achievement. This year all the people my age are approaching their second year of uni and meanwhile I haven't even managed the f*cking A Levels I need to get there. I'm supposed to be all that gifted shit &amp; I got A*s at GCSE and I took four or five A levels, depending on how they're counted (Physics, Chem, Further Math, Computing) and people even described me as the one most suited to uni. Oh really ?!?!? I'm a socially anxious avoidant personality disordered agoraphobic derealizing perfectionist who is terrified of academic performance, but please, tell me how I'd obviously thrive in a competitive social environment full of superior humans. Oh boi. Goddamn I'm a piece of stupid sh*t and I resent all the neurotypical people who just floated into university like it's a piece of cake. I hate everything so much. I hate me and I hate everyone and I hate the world and I wish for death every single day because I'm evidently worthless according to middle class English society.I realise this is probably an incomprehensible rant and I'm just another conplaining little piece of sh*t who is wasting her brain and I know my thinking is faulty but I don't care because my feelings drown out any rational thinking I have about my life. My brain and life are both irreparably fucked and I hope death comes soon. Two and a half years rotting away in my bedroom, and counting.
