I live with my ex (we're still friends, of course), and his parents, I can't hold a job, I don't have a car, I'm diagnosed with general anxiety, social anxiety, depression, ADHD, and Cerebral Palsy.Those disorders cause me to be an asshole, on top of me getting my father's anger passed down to me, so, I can be a complete raging asshole at times. My social anxiety also sometimes makes me feel like I'm being judged when I'm out in public.I am finally taking meds for all of this, except for my cerebral palsy, though. It's only been 7 days, though, so, they haven't started working yet (should be just three more days, yay!)...I can't even fathom talking to anybody to make friends or attempt to get a date, male or female, unless it's online, and, even then, I'm still a fucking pussy about it. Also, as much of an unpopular opinion this may be, it doesn't help that I'm a white male, seeing as how we are currently being demonized by idiots that spread this bullshit that all white males are racist, sexist, and, privileged (though, I do agree that we do get less bullshit thrown our way by the government, corrupt police, etc.), and, lead fuckin perfect lives (Yea, because being suicidal, and having anxiety attacks is SOOOOOOOO fucking great!).So, with all this, I feel like I'm screwed when it comes to finding a date, or, a job, because who would want to date a 23 year old guy who lives with his ex, and his parents, has no friends, other than my ex and a chick in Minnesota that I met online, is inflicted with depression, social and general anxiety, ADHD, and, Cerebral Palsy (though, it's not severe Cerebral Palsy... The most obvious symptoms that I have from it are shit balance, occasional fucked up walking, and, constantly tripping over my words), has no car, and no source of income? I do have some guy trying to talk to me, but, he's coming across as only wanting sex, and, I want a relationship, rather that just sex. I'm not the type of person to just go around screwing anybody I can.And, who would want to hire somebody that suffers from anxiety, depression, ADHD, and Cerebral Palsy? Luckily, I may be eligible for disability, but, I hear it's a pain in the ass to get approved for disability, and, I'd feel like I'm basically mooching off of people who do work...So, yea, I think I'm pretty screwed. lol
