Don't know if this is the right place for this, let me know if it isn't. I know I need help, I do. I can barely get up in the mornings, work doesn't get done and everything makes me feel overwhelmed. Yet, I can't bring myself to get help. I have had feelings of depression and anxiety for 5+ years (many symptoms of PTSD) and I just always kept my fingers crossed that I would magically get better. It's only gotten worse and worse and over the past year or so I've started to realize that I need professional help if I ever want to accomplish anything. Seeing a psychologist is quite easy where I live, as well as affordable. But I can't bring myself to go. I'm worried that I'll get overwhelmed and lose control over my emotions, or that he/she won't take me serious, that it's going to make things worse or that the psychologist will think I'm lying/think I'm blowing things out of proportion. I've been stuffing my feelings down for so long that I'm worried about what will happen when I finally share them. Has anyone else here been through this or has advice?I don't want to spend the rest of my life being miserable
