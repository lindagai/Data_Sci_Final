Honestly, I really know where you are coming from. I can say that we can feel love though. I didn't know such a feeling existed till I had children. Children that love you no matter what. I still want to die daily due to not being able to see them everyday. Not being able to hear the screams of "daddy" when I get home. Having to leave them when they beg me to stay. And I mean beg. As if their own happiness depended upon me staying and I have to leave. The fact that I keep making things worse for myself because of that pain. That's why I want to end things. But you're right, it's for selfish reasons that we do want to end it.
