Wasted 8 years of my life, which is basically half of my life, thinking I would be able to get out of depression by myself, walking straight to shit without noticing what I was heading to, by then I thought I was going in the right direction. Spent those fucking 8 years doing shit that never filled me not a single bit. Practiced many sports, graduated from high school, got my english speaker degree, managed to get in one of the greatest medicine schools of my country, developed a lot of art skills, drawing, painting, writting, music, I got a loving family, friends that care, and I used to have a girlfriend that would have done anything for me, to help me. Things that would fill most people hearts. 8 years that were suppose to be a lot of success and joy. Now here I am, a 19 year old, drowning in sorrow and feeling anger towards myself, wanting to fucking suicide and end this shit for once at all. How come that I have so many good things Im my life, so many accomplishments, and I feel so miserable? What's the point then? living a good life and being totally unable to freaking enjoy it. Just want this to end, doesn't matter how, I just want it to fucking end. And now that I finally told my family, theres pretty much nothing the can actually do. They told me to wait, to fucking cheer up, that they are seeking help, but how the fucking hell I'm supposed to keep waiting? I fucking tired of it, I have been doing so for the last 8 years. I get frustrated at bed if I hadn't fallen sleep in 5 min (closest thing to being dead) Now I need to wait 1 or 2 more weeks, my patience ran out long time ago.
