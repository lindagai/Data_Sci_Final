I've lost all motivation to try and put up the mask. I've done it for years, trying to come off as a confident, outgoing, goofy sorta guy. I always tried to present myself as that guy who's always up for a laugh, not too serious. I've tried the 'fake it til you make it' approach, and I just can't do it anymore. I can't hide the crippling feelings of failure, loneliness and self hatred. I can't hide the disappointment in knowing that my ugly mug means I've never known any true love, and never will. I can't hide how flawed my personality is, that when people know me, truly know me, they're repulsed.  Every day I resent myself even more. Every day I I reflect on how deep I'm going in the hole. There's no light at the end of the tunnel for me anymore, and it scares me. I'd kill myself if I wasn't such a pussy, but I'd rather just rant about it on the internet. I'm just at a loss at what to do now.
