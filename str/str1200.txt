I've been sick for 16 months or who knows how long w some unrelenting Gastro issue. GI can't figure it out, but there are enough really general blood results (showing inflammation generally etc) that make the medical community believe something is up. Anyway, I've been on a considerable amount of phenergan for most of that time. Around Christmas I had to drop the last of the anti-psychotics we had tried because it was apparent that I can't tolerate them as a class. I get strange EPS symptoms of different fun shapes and colors from all of the many we have tried. I also am a sufferer of frequent intense migraines and am on prophylactic meds for those.Anyway, today my eye started twitching around noon. I honestly thought it was part of a new migraine symptomology since my auras have changed recently (my neuro knows). Like an idiot though, I went to google. I found out phenergan can cause tardive dyskinesia. TD is my very worst nightmare. I was on atypicals for a long time before December, and have been on this stupidly high dose of phenergan for a year so I mean... AGGKK! I'm really hoping I wake up tomorrow and the twitch is gone and I am being a hypochondriac freak over nothing.Ending up with TD for the rest of my life because I was trying to treat other stuff that is likely life long is not really an acceptable outcome. I am sure I am just overreacting and that is why I am reminding everyone not to google things. It's a TERRIBLE idea. End of PSA.
