I have been depressed for almost two years now and it has not gotten any better. It is worse now and they prescribe meds for me to feel happy. It isn't working. I only have two friends, well technically one. One of them is always saying how annoying I am and rarely does stuff with me outside of school. I have always been annoying, I can't help myself its just who I am. I am in vacation and I am lonely. I try to make new friends but they say I am annoying. My only social interactions if from school. I don't want to graduate because I know I will be a loner in college.  I have been trying to get a girlfriend so I don't feel alone but just been rejected many times. I am pretty sure I'll die alone and not have started a family. I have always had suicidal thoughts but I am to scare to see what happens after death. Prom is coming soon for me. I've been thinking if I don't have a  prom date I might just end it on the parking lot of where prom is. Too scare to tell my therapist of what I feel because I'll end up in the hospital.
