i'm 28. i've had OCD and depression since i was 8, when suicidal thoughts became a way of coping with my situation as a kid. it was always there if i needed it. 20 years later, depression keeps me from getting anything but F's in school, or working in anything that's meanigful. all i do is fail. the only man i've ever trusted enough to be in a relationship with, and the only person who ever said they loved me, suddenly stopped loving me one day several months ago and left. he turned all of my "friends" against me, and now i've run away to a foreign country, with a language i don't speak, where my death could easliy be masked as a homicide or an accident. i cannot connect to people. all i can feel is emptiness, fear and profound sadness. every day, for hours, i can't stop shaking. my year with this ex was the only time i've ever felt comfortable and whole in my consciousness, but he lied and betrayed me simply because it would make things more convenient for him. now i'm back to being an isolated fragment from the rest of humanity. if i kill myself i'll be killing my mom too. i disgust myself with the selfishness of this, but i've reached a very finite limit. i can't continue to be. please help me.
