I'm in the same boat.  I just moved to a new city six hours away and started working here six months ago and I have a really hard time staying focused even though objectively, I should be in my element with this work.I also spend most of my day reminding myself to make it through so, if for no other reason, I can go home, make nachos, read, and play Destiny.  It helps, but it also makes me sad that that's all I can get excited about now.  And I use the word \"excited\" loosely.
