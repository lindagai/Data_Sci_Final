Well 4 months ago, I found someone who actually wanted to be in a relationship with me, I made it known upfront that I was a depressive, but she understood, wanted to learn more, wanted to help.Well today, things finished between us, the cause, my depression, it would seem that even having someone who wanted to understand, who wanted to help wasnt enough for my screwed up brain and condition.  That I would rather hide in myself, pull away and do everything I normally would, and in that regard pushing the person that loved me away so much that they and I were left with no choice.For a brief moment I had a hope that I was more than what I am, but I was wrong, I am really just a broken shell of something looking like a person.  Sure I will smile, and chat and laugh at your jokes, but there is nothing but a hollow void behind these eyes.  I wont involve myself in your life anymore, because you don't deserve to see behind the curtain, to see how hollow I now am, you don't deserve to be affected by this toxic atmosphere I seem to have around me.And, I know you will never read this, or if you do you may not even know if was me.  But I really did love you, if only I could have been more, been stronger, been...something...I would have spent the rest of my life trying to show you how much you meant to me.
