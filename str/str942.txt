So, I tried to kill myself in January, failed, and got myself in a psychiatric clinic, where I've spented 2 months.Now I'm currently taking Bupropion, duloxetine, topiramat and Naltrexone. That's a lot of med's right? I know.I suffer from major depression, social anxiety and alcoholism. Now, that medication ins't working anymore, for some god damn reason and now I have to take a new med. For people who don't know the drill, the first few weeks are very awful, until your body get used to the new med, you will suffer from at least 2 of a list of a thousand plagues.The new one is called Depokote, and the one the is going out is Topiramat. Now I'm with a god awful headache and a constant feeling that I'm about to trow up. Plus I can't sleep!I do know that this is for my benefit and all, but the knowledge that this is going to last at least two weeks makes me just... tired.Oh, and I can't just stop taking Topiramat at a moments notice, no. You have to reduce 25mg from a dose that I'm taking of 100mg (I was taking 200mg but that made me smart as the presidential, so). Every two days that this event occurs, I feel like I'm loosing my mind! I get hiper excited and barely can control myself.Just wanted to vent... feeling pretty shity right now and I don't have friends so yeah, social anxiety and all.I won't give up on life, it's just sometimes hard you know.Looking at the bright side I managed to overcome alcoholism so that's a start.To the depressive community, big hugs and I wish that you guys find some peace. There is no right or wrong.
