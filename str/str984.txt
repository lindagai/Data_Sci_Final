I have always been severely depressed for as long as I can remember, but I have always did my best to handle it but recently I just feel like I'm coming apart, like I am going insane or something. I have tried every medicine my doctor could think of to get it under control, but they always come with a side effect, the last time we tried something it made me gain an immense amount of weight and I am already extremely morbidly obese. (I think this is my way of slowly killing myself.)I have always know that suicide was a possibility, but now more than ever I want to die. I am too weak to kill myself every time I get close to even trying I chicken out, but I would not be afraid of death, if I were to get hit by a car tomorrow and die, I would not regret it. How do you guys handle urges like this?
