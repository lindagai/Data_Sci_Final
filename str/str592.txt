...is a tumblr site. I've been up the last couple of hours reading through these things that were submitted. Although all of them are sad, the ones that get me and make me cry are the one from people with depression.I completely understand those text. I've sent out messages asking for help and not getting a response. It shows me how people don't care until its to late. I feel so sad for those that commit suicide and all it would have took to save them was someone actually caring like they pretend to do after they find out that person is did. Just so sad and scary, cause I've been there so many times and most times I was able to snap out of it and the attempts I made I've been lucky enough to live through. It's a fight and some time we lose and pay the ultimate price.
