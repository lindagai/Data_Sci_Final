Well rich or not be who you are not what they expect you too Sometimes I'm playing Xbox and I say man whats next I get a meh feeling like damn life gets so boring, that's my fault because I don't go out there. But well if I could help you out some way in some advice I'll just say if life is pointless and stuff why don't you make the most of it make it less boring if possible? I had a dream once that slowly I'd help people out and let them remember my name I know I wont be like Muhammad Ali and stuff but if some one some person out there I helped remembers my name when I die I'll be satisfied to tell you the true I have slowly gave up and forgotten, I've realized being illegal here with Trump on my ass I wont get far but talking to you now make me realize,  YEAH I WONT GET ANYWHERE, NOT WITH THAT ATTITUDE I WONT. So in a way thank you for allowing me to talk out and talk to you, you have helped me out today.
