I'm 18 years old and since Ive been getting older its gotten a lot worse. When I was a kid I had very bad anxiety that started when I was around 8. I would cry when I had to go to school and I had a terrible phobia of throwing up. Like even eating would scare me. Eventually I got over it and now I'm fine with going to school and stuff like that. Now it seems like I have a different anxiety. I think about how mentally unstable I am and how much I don't have control of and I think of all the mistakes I've made in the past and how I don't deserve to be loved because of them. I also feel like I don't think the right way. Like I'll be sitting with a friend waiting for the bus and this feeling will randomly hit me and I keep thinking and thinking about it. I feel like no one else thinks as much as me and then I feel like I'm going insane and I'll end up in an asylum. All of my fears combine into one big feeling which I call "the feeling" and whenever I get the feeling I feel so trapped in my own head. It's awful. My biggest fear is that one day I'll kill myself because of it. I'm also so terrified of death but sometimes I don't want to me alive. Please help. I'm just so messed up. I can try to talk to my friends about it but they don't understand this kind of stuff that well. What should I do? I also have a feeling that NO ONE else in the world feels this way and it gives me even more anxiety. Everyone else I know who suffers from anxiety is more scared of the future or going to work or stuff like that. I feel like I'm in hell sometimes and I'm scared I'll be like this forever :(I also try to figure out what is causing my feelings but analyzing myself just makes it worse
