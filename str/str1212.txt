I am in the same situation as you my friend. But the break up has only encouraged me to step out of the dark depression/anxiety ridden world I'm in. I'm done having people I love leave me because of my depression and anxiety. For the first time in my life I really want to change who I am so I'd stop hurting people I love. I hope you'll find it in yourself to crawl out of this dark hole and be happy. We all deserve to be happy but we've gotta work fucking hard for it......
