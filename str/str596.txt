I've recently been working on trying to challenge my negative thoughts, and sometimes it works ok. But if I'm really tired, which I am quite a lot of the time (even if I get a good 8hrs sleep, I'm tired by the evening even if I haven't exerted myself that much), I find it's much harder to challenge those thoughts and I'm more likely to feel miserable. I dunno if this is just a scapegoat or that's actually how it is for other people?
