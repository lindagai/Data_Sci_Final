I'm asking the same question today, rabbit. I just want to sleep. All day. Sometimes I get up and make coffee. We have a commercial brewer in the office and I happen to know how to work it. It's an easy task and it makes me think I have accomplished something, even if it's small and useless. Best of luck to you.
