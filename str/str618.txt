You are not being fair to yourself, crazy people don't introspect. You are not the \"Crazy Girl\".We all have relationships that fizzle or don't work out.  We learn from our mistakes, and try and do better next time.You *deserve* love and affection! Explore, have fun, when you find someone else that you like, take it slow.
