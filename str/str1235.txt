I have thought about this many a time and the best I came up with is this:I am only pretty sure that being dead is better than living. At different times in my life I felt differently about that statement. Right now it feels sort of tongue in cheek because I am doing better, but at other times in my life it has felt like the honest to gods truth. Either way there are few things in this life that are a certainty and I do not trust my perceptions enough to make that call.
