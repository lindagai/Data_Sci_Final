I am 14 years old and a freshman in high school, and for a couple months now I've been sexually attracted to my aunt. I've been trying to not think about it or act on it (haven't acted on it), but sometimes I do think about and feel disgusted with myself. I am still going through puberty (maybe I finished it, I'm not sure), and I just want to know if this is normal. I have not told anyone yet and don't plan to. Please and thank you.
