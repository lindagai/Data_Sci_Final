I'll back you to the end i know it doesnt have the same depth as if it was coming from a friend or family but sometimes your friends could be sitting in the trench right beside you facing the same fight. We might be a bunch of random people in today's society but when one falls we hurt just as much. I still think the same way you do right now and the greatest thing i have ever been told is water will find its own level . Meaning youll be up and down but youll find your level it may take days,months and even years but everything happens for a reason. Kinda like eating a slice of cake you can take the worst part first and get the best for last or the other way around. It will work out for you and all you have to do is keep grinding away.  Sorry it's so long but hope it helps after all im in the same trench.
