I know I will come across as a whiny brat because I have food,clean water, a roof above my head, a room all my own and no one even pressures me to try and do anything except my gf. I have failed so many times since I left home I'm afraid if I try again it'll happen again. When I failed before I tried killing myself because I felt hopeless but now all I do is lay around waiting till I've paid off my debts so I can kill myself and ensure no one has my problems as a burden on them. I feel so worthless complaining about this even now.
