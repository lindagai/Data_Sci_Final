I'm struggling with depression for 9 months or more now and I started seeing a psychologist 2-2,5 months ago.       It didn't help me in any way. Not even a little.      She just makes me do these tests probably cuz she wants to know more about me but I just tend to block and can't answer simple question about myself because I don't care about anything.        Fuck my nihilism.       How much time does it take to recover? I'm so suicidal every single fucking day I think I will just kill myself.       I don't even know what's exactly wrong with me. I'm going insane.
