my parents won't let me hang out with my best friend bc of the last time we hung out i took some xanax and was out of it for like a few days and now i'm worried they won't ever let me see her or hang with her again and i want to kill myself because she's the only friend i have and i went through a very long falling out with my old best friend and i barely got through it and i can't do that again i fucking cant and they dont get it ;-;
