Whenever i reach the point where i think everything seems so pointless, and i could just die right now and everything would be over and the world wouldn't give a shit, i introspect on how depressed i feel, what lead to it, etc. and i kind of like consume it until i feel numb (I'm not sure if i made sense). And then for the better part when i feel kind of or completely numb, i read random things (e.g. from academic journals about how justice in the workplace affect productivity to what makes a poop smell bad) and it makes me feel better. It gives me a hope that things do make sense even if my life is pointless. Maybe try finding something you can easily distract yourself with.
