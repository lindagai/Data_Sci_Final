So I just went by the pharmacy, I always refill via my pharmacy app, I got a notice that it would be ready by Friday at 11 am. I didn't have time yesterday to pick it up so I went just now and the pharmacist said it wouldn't be ready until Monday. I took my last pill last night though. What the fuck do I do?? I'm freaking the fuck out!
