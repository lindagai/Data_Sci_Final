I wonder if it could just be a coincidence, too, though. Like maybe you and your twin were going to lose your eyebrow hairs but just happened to be a few months apart and just happened to be around the time you started citalopram? You could always wear makeup for your eyebrows, though I guess you might not be as comfortable with it since you are a guy? It can look very natural though. Or you can get those eyebrow tattoos.
