Yes, with lots of limitations.I don't think being suicidal should be a reason for allowing assisted suicide. But if you can say that your depression is essentially terminal - ie. you can't function to the point that you're on disability, you've tried medication, long term therapy, inpatient treatment, etc. with no improvement - then perhaps it could be considered.I've had times in the past where I would've wholeheartedly thrown myself into assisted suicide, but with better treatment I wouldn't do it now. It should be more accessible for people with terminal illnesses, but mental illnesses mean you're not making rational choices, so it needs limitations.
