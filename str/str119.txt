Definitely get to know your professors and apply for internships. Your professors can give you leads for work and be used as references later. Not doing that was one of the biggest mistakes I made.Keep a planner where you write down all your homework and exams for the week/month/semester. A lot of times I'd be too depressed and tired to go through my stuff to find the syllabus for each class, but if all I had to do was open my planner it was much easier to get started on a task.
