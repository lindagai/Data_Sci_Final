Hi I would like to start off by saying congrats on graduation(that shit ain't easy, especially when dealing with depression)! I would say to you to try and find professional help, and if you have that already share these feelings with them. These feelings could be you or the depression, it's such a fucked up thing to try and distinguish:/. Also  try and remember your not alone, try finding a support group that is filled with individuals that deal with the same things. I find my favourite people to talk to are people who understand what it's like having a mental disorder(not all professionals do, even though they are still useful). And I mean you have already started that by posting here. Anyway hope this possibly provided some sort of help in some way.FYI( I include this cause I find advice is only good if you know it source) I suffer from depression, has been 8 years best I can tell(22 years old now). I have one semester left in my degree. Defiantly not the best at managing my depression, it's been a battle of two steps forward one back.
