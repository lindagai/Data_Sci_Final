I always try to avoid meeting coworkers in the cafeteria during coffee and lunch breaks. Why is that? It is not due to my introversion or lack of people's skills. It's actually due to the following.   I'm gonna be asked questions (casual and work-related)and I won't be able to grasp these questions for the first time. So I'll ask them to repeat, which bothers them. So they repeat, but I still don't grasp all of the question. Only parts of it due to the fog that is covering my brain. I also take a lot of time to come up with an answer to the partly grasped question. When I do find the answer, I have trouble communicating it because I'll have to think about how to phrase it, anxiety plays a major role too as I'm thinking about what the will be thinking about what I'll say before I speak so I end up giving a barely relevant poorly phrased word-scrambled reply that annoys/confuses or draws away the asker. After having this happened to me so many times I started hoping that I don't run to anybody on the kitchen floor to avoid the awkwardness.
