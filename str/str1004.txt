26yo, male, i don't have a degree, i don't have any talent or ability whatsoever, i'm terrible with social interactions, i had jobs before but i fucked up in every single one, i'm ugly, dumb, poor, virgin, have zero friends.I'm so fucking tired of this terrible existence, i have no fucking idead what to do with my life, i want to die so bad but i know that this will be terrible for my mother, she is the only reason that i didn't killed myself yet but my situation is so fucking terrible that i don't think i can continue with this thing anymore. Why the fuck did i was even born in the first place? Why a fucking useless piece of shit like me was born on this world?I failed so much in my life, so many wrong choices and wasted time on useless stuff. I hate myself so much and this fucking unemployment situation is destroying my sould and mind even more.
