that's why i don't tell them. they have their own problems that no one in my family ever talk about. On top of all that my family for god knows how long have said \"Take care of your mom.\" \"look out for your mother.\" \"are you giving her a hand at home.\"When the hell are people going to care about me?! So no i cant tell my family. I have to putt on that mask i have spent years perfecting, that bright happy person they have all grown to love.
