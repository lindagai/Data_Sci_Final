**TL;DR**: Everything in my life is failing.I want to start with positives. I have a job I love, I have a girlfriend,  I have a roof over my head (for now). I have internet and a computer and electricity. Ok, yes I have all of that I'm not half as bad off as other people. What has me depressed is the rest of my life. I haven't been able to work for the past 3 months. My girlfriend is showing signs of being suicidal (IE: talking about not wanting to go on anymore), she has a history of suicide, as well as PTSD, Anxiety, Agoraphobia, and depression. She can't leave the house unless it's really required such as a doctor's appointment. I've run out of money, and nearly all my food but noodles and butter. I have no-one to turn to for help financially. I'm waiting on my disability to get approved and it's taken much longer than expected. I'm in pain all the time, the few times I'm not I work around the house in a fruitless attempt at keeping my apartment clean. My girlfriend can't clean due to her illness. I hate my life and my situation but I love my girlfriend. God, why am I writing this?
