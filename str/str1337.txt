I've been in a similar situation. I'm 28 and I've been in and out of psychiatric hospitals. A few times I lied to get out but it ended up hurting me later because I wasn't ready. I have two cats and I love them more than anything because they are my buddies. I'm sorry about your rape and him getting off easy. The judicial system sucks, I had an ex steal 3 grand from my bank account and they wouldn't press charges. I had a guy have sex without my consent and I didn't tell anyone because they would say I asked for it. What helped me most was counseling and medicine, although it took years to find the right doctor and medicine. Although this isn't for everyone. I do have fleeting suicidal thoughts depending on circumstances or sometimes they come randomly. It's hard, I can't say for sure everything will go away but it made me stronger after years. I use to hate myself for having depression and I blamed myself. But like any mental illness, its illness and I didn't cause it. The best I can do is accept that I have it and do my best to not let it get me down.
