I’ve found that when we are able to open up and talk to each other about how we’re feeling and how we’ve been doing, without the threat of being demeaned, delegitimized, made fun of, hospitalized, or have the police called on us, something very powerful happens. A safe space is created, friends are made, experiences and mutual aid are shared, and people begin to heal. Without professionals breathing down our necks with a diagnostic label and prescription in hand, we are able to explore what it means to feel—to truly feel what we feel—and work through it with caring others with us on the journey.
