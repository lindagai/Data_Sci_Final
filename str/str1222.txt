Thanks. I think it just exacerbates my depression. I don't think it's a cause. I'm just so sick of taking this test. I wonder sometimes if I should kill myself if I don't pass this time. I know that's extreme but I every time I don't pass I just beat myself up over it. I'm trying not too but it's hard.
