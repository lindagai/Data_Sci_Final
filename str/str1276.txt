There really isn't any light. There are only two people that keep me from killing myself. One is my mom who I only speak to like twice a week. And the other is someone who isn't even speaking to me anymore but I know if I kill myself she will think it's her fault. And even if she doesn't want anything to do with me she is still the only person I truly care about and I can't stand the thought of her blaming herself for my death.
