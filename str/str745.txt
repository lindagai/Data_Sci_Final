So my only friend is moving away to Idaho in a few days, and at the moment she's staying with us. At first it was nice to have someone around. It distracted me from my usual feelings of not wanting to be alive. Unfortunately, I'm such a shitty human being that having her around is now driving me insane. Let me back up a bit and explain.I have suffered from depression since 2nd grade and have been in bed for two years with chronic lyme disease. Most days, I'm too sick to leave the house or remain standing for more than 10 minutes. I am so sick and tired of being trapped in my house unable to do anything, but even more so, I hate that it took away my ability to be creative. I used to write novels in my spare time, draw, make little home movies. Now I can't do anything. I don't know how to formulate sentences anymore. I've forgotten half of my vocabulary. I've taken over $100 worth of online figure drawing classes but I still can't draw shit. I've bought a professional drawing tablet and some expensive video editing apps that I'll never use.I am utterly useless.Now, enter my friend, who practically spends her entire life doing the above things. She's always drawing masterpieces and writing great books and people on the internet admire her. Over the course of 3 days, I've gone from being so happy to have her around to being more depressed than I have been in a while. She's shown me just what an utter failure of a human being I am just by being herself. It hurts so much. I should have been aborted. I want to die but I'm too much of a pussy to do it. And what hurts the most is knowing that while she's only here for four more days, and I'm crying in my room. I'm wasting what little time I have left with her because I'm unstable. I'm pushing her away because she makes me feel inadequate. I am a horrible, horrible, terrible, terrible friend and I deserve to die.
