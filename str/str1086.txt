You might be right. It has gotten pretty shitty in the last few weeks. There were three days in a row where I could hardly bring myself to bother eating half a sandwich and I showered once. I've never had symptoms like this before. A potent dose of self-hatred, sleep problems, and anxiety is my usual. I've had more intense suicidal ideation before, but never this complete numbness and apathy. It didn't get to the point where I couldn't get out of bed, but I was getting there. Thank you for your input from someone who knows what It's like to feel this way most or all of your life. I am very sad that it started so young for you though. 7. Shit, I was still playing with Pokemon at that age.
