I thought about that when I was going through my most severe bout of depression this winter after my break up. I couldn't get out of bed, I wouldn't eat because I didn't have the energy to get up and cook something, I lost 4 kg in a month, and I'm not someone whose weight varies at all (fast metabolism). I wasn't hungry or I was but food would kind of make me gag. I felt like a horrible mother because I could barely get out of bed just to take my fur baby out for his walks, and would be irritated the whole time we were out. I would just stay in bed and binge a series from the time I woke up to the time I went back to sleep, crying in between. I so wanted to hire someone to come take care of me, take both me and my kid out for walks, help me cook, etc. But I figured it was too expensive and I don't have those kinds of funds. It's a good idea though. Depression is a certain disability. People with disabilities get this kind of help all the time, sometimes even state paid. Imagine if we could get that kind of aid.
