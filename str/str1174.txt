Hi. I just found this subreddit. I think I might be able to fit here.Here's a quick bio of me. I have had trouble with sadness for a long time, and it started around high school. I often felt that I wasn't accepted or wasn't good enough, by girls or whatever. That took a toll on my mood. Whenever I felt moody, it was harder for me to concentrate for my grades and such. Then I felt bad that I was getting worse grades. This pattern of sadness kept with me all through college. After 6 years I completed an aerospace engineering degree, ending up with a 2.5 gpa and no work experience. Now, I am in a weird spot where I can't get an easy/normal job because I look overqualified, and I can't get an engineering job because I am underqualified.I have always enjoyed games. It is my main hobby. It's nice to have a place where I am accepted and can succeed, instead of in real life where I feel I am rejected and shunned. Right now, I'm trying to figure out a way to provide for myself at least. I am currently living with my brother across the US. I thought maybe that people here would be more inclined to hire me, but even Target didn't want to after I interviewed with them. I might be trying to join the Air Force as an officer, but I am worried about getting good letters of recommendation. I was hoping to get a recommendation from an employer, but I haven't gotten a job.
