I feel so guilty for bringing her into this world. She didnt ask me to. I should have been more careful... but she's here now. And what if i actually kill myself one day. What if my guilt of leaving her motherless isn't enough one day. Her dad would never understand. He doesnt understand how much i hate the way my brain works. How slow and un normal i feel. How i see everyone around me being able to cope and im just here. Stuck. Depending on everyone else. Unable to commit to actually do something with my life. Im pathetic.  I'd be doing her a favor.
