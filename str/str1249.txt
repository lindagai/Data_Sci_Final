When people say it always gets better that's partially true.When depressed we see the world in a way of black and white. It's impossible to see the white when swallowed in black.Normalcy to me is a roller coaster, some hills are hard to climb and there may be drops much steeper than others. But in the end you have a fun ride.Things go up and down because happiness isn't linear, I'm sure you're aware of this. But remember that your roller coaster is broken and you haven't even experienced the ride. You don't know how this will end, you predict badly but that's only because of the now. Your life is more valuable than depression is letting you see. You are incapable of knowing this right now.I used to suffer from suicidal ideation and one very serious attempt last fall, but it can and will go away if you work for fixing it. You were unlucky and born with a broken roller coaster, and it cannot be fixed by just sitting there.This black pit isn't forever. You think it is, I know you do. But I know what you're thinking and I've seen the other side. One of us is wrong.
