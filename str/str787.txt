I want to die. Here's the thing, I'm a legit terrible person. I suffer from sever sex addition and into some nasty hardcore stuff, some of it is questionable . I have tried to stop so many times, I prayed, I've  gone to doctors, but no luck. I hurt those i love, and I feel trapped as a person because I can't be who I want to be. That alone will get me killed (rightfully so) but also shame my family, which they have no fault in. I was raised well, good loving home, and everything. All hope is lost, all faith is gone. I won't kill myslef, but i wont stop something from happening. I just need to die. I'm not crying for help, because there isn't any, not for a piece of scum like me. I do care about my family, I do worry about them. But I also no longer feel I have a purpose in life. The one thing I truly loved doing was being a soldier. Then I got out. Worst mistake ever. I tried going back in, several times, only to be told over and over, no. I got a good job, I hate it. I got a great family. But I hurt them emotionally all the time. I don't care about other people, only myself. If its not my way it's the high way. However, as strange as it sounds, I refuse to shoot myself. Because I'm a huge supporter of the 2nd Amendment, I don't want to tarnish guns and their owners. But I lack balls to kill myself because I worry about my family and how they will be after I'm gone. So instead I put on a fake smile and act like everything is good. Life is a prison, there's no escape. If I did here I'm surely doomed to be prisoner in hell. All hope is lost for me.
