I want to feel some kind of release. To be able to feel anything else besides pain. I wish I could talk to someone about my hopelessness but instead I'm here. Pouring my heart out on a keyboard. And for what? Its not like I'm gonna gain anything from it. My whole life has been in shambles for as long as I could remember....I do my best not to burden anyone...cuz I know I'm not worth the time. Everything I've ever done has been thrown in my face time and time again. Nothing I do is right. I'm always wrong no matter what I do. There is nothing for me. I could never be loved no matter how much love I give. I've come to terms with knowing no one would ever accept a broken person like me. In my younger days I was naive to think I could find acceptance or even happiness. Now at the tender age of 20 I have freed my eyes to an eternal prize. The truth. I am worthy of all the names I have been given. Useless. Ugly. Worthless. Waste. Disgrace. Unsightly. Disgusting. And so much more. I have all these feelings...which is so unfortunate. To be completely honest I want to die. I'm not living for myself or anyone else. I want my life to be taken from me just like everything else has been. It's not like I'm doing anything good or productive with it. I'm a stain in people's life so it'd be best for me to be erased. I don't want this life. I don't want this hurt. I don't want this pain. I don't want this despair. Most of all I don't want these tears of agony and a desperate attempt for help. Maybe...just maybe if I had just one friend in the world then maybe I wouldn't feel so lonely.
