I find myself wanting to suicide at some point but I keep delaying it a few months here a year there because there are somethings I want to do first. Right now I want to learn to drive so I can feel more independent, go to college at least for a little to have some fun and not be so alone, and I want to turn 21. I think I want to die happy. I guess its sort of a bucket list. Idk if bye the time I finish these things I might want others, or I might not. If the latter maybe I die, if the former well I guess we'll see.
