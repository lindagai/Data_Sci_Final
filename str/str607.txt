I'm so sorry you're feeling that way, but grateful you shared with us.  For most of my life I've felt the same way.  I want to tell you something I only recently learned:  EVERYONE is beautiful and worthy of love.  Not just friend love or family love but romantic and physical love.  You, yes, YOU deserve this.  As you are.  Not as some \"better\" version of yourself.  You are beautiful.  You've just been told too many times by too many people (or maybe just one person, in your head), by the media, that you're not beautiful.  DON'T BELIEVE THEM.  Those thoughts just exist to keep you down.  You deserve to fly. I know these words may sound goofy, cheesy, untrue.   But I swear to you (this took me 38 years to realize), it IS true.  Life is what you make of it.  You can believe in yourself.  You deserve love.  If he didn't love you the way you deserved, someone else who deserves YOUR love will love you back.  I know this. I promise.  And you're not alone in this.  Keep talking, and if you'd like to consider that perhaps I may have a point(?), I'm happy to send you many things that could help you really feel this way about yourself too. Love yourself.  You gotta love yourself.
