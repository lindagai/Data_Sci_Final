Evidence continues to mount that I am just straight up not equipped to be a human being.My entire life has been about compromise. Realizing that I was basically not ever able to do anything without being slightly destructive and accepting the destruction so I could focus on things that were more important to me... Like not screaming constantly at the top of my lungs from the horrible pain of existence (I tried that out in highschool and all it did was get me hauled to the principal's office).Honestly I'm *So* bad at orientation, planning and detail work that I've built up an absurd tolerance for things getting delayed or taken from me or just straight up ignored that I don't think anyone actually knows how it's even possible I function while my world not so much burns as mildly smolders around me.Of course, if I was alone in the world this would hardly be an issue, but I am forced to share it with other people. I deeply dislike inconveniencing them, but honestly, if you complain about the way I live enough I just get exhausted.Seriously it's like "oh you're going to get charged extra because that was dumb." or "oh it's going to take you longer because your way is inefficient." and I'm just like. "I wake up every morning and try to come up with reasons not to eat my own arm okay?"If I can accomplish anything, in any way I will do it because the other option is doing literally nothing or becoming horribly destructive.It's inefficient, clunky and painful to watch, but I assure you it is much, much better than the alternative...I don't want to live like this anymore. I don't know how to stop.
