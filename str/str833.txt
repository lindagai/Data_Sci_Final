What is wrong with me? I'm going to a good University, my parents and siblings love me, I have friends that are fun to hang out with, yet I'm still fucking pathetic. I did nothing but stay inside and play video games this week and I feel fucking awful. I tried exercising a few times but it doesn't help. I try. I really do try. I just want to die right now.
