You did have some success. I know it's hard but focus on those times. You can repeat them. I consider myself lucky in my mid twenties I finally got help through medication and everything clicked into place... At least for a while. That was my success. I've had many failures too and I blame them on my illness. It's not your fault. I hope you get help and rack up more of those successes and a lot less of the failures.
