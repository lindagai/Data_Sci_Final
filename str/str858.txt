I'll start by saying I don't have ADHD. I've had anxiety my whole life (social phobia) and depression as a result of it. I cope with it and it has not been too overbearing recently. My social phobia is mostly gone.I ended a 5 year relationship about 9 months ago. I've been single and alone since (no relations with women at all). About a week ago I chatted with a girl on Tinder and she asked to meet me the next day. I didn't sleep that night (possibly date anxiety) and had an okay time the next day. Since the night I spoke to her I have had a non-stop source of adrenaline. Apart from talking to a bunch of new people, there are no new stresses in my life. Everything is normal.I have been unable to sit still. I am constantly active and talking to people. I am hyper hyper hyper and unloading verbally onto anyone I can. I invited a different girl from work over my place for dinner and we spent the night together (hyperactivity = confidence). I spent hours each night on dating websites talking to women. I cannot stop myself. Talking to people is the no1 thing that distracts me.This is great in some obvious ways, but when I am home alone I want to die. The adrenaline is hitting my chest and I cannot alleviate it. I want to die, this is too much.I'm 28 and this is the first time I've experienced it. I understand that after long periods of depression a person can have brief periods of hyperactivity, but does it last this long? I eat once a day now. My stomach aches and I really don't want to eat anything. I am worried that I will wake up tomorrow and feel the exact opposite I do now, like a hang-over. I am becoming scared and I feel out of control. I am frightened of what will happen when these feelings finally go away.Has anyone else experienced long periods of hyperactivity like this, out of the blue?
