And I'm sitting here alone in my dark room, without friends, money, job, living with my parents. I dropped out from college a year ago and haven't met anyone since then because of my social anxiety. I wake up, I eat (sometimes) and go back to sleep. I'm also addicted to porn and video games. It feels like it's impossible to deal with it alone. I'm not surprised with nobody wanting me in their life, I wouldn't like to be friends with a person like me neither. I love to sleep, sometimes I dream that I have a life. Then I wake up and cry. I can't live like this anymore. Happy birthday to all of you who are 'celebrating' today as well.
