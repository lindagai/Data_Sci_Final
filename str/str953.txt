Hey everyone, i don't know if this is the right place for this or not but i feel like I'm depressed. For a little background, my fiancee cheated on me and left me a month ago. She betrayed my trust like no one has before and i don't know how to recover.Everything i do, say, think about, literally everything, makes me think of her. She meant everything to me. Ever since she left, nothing that i enjoyed doing makes me happy anymore. It just makes me think of her more. I just feel empty inside. I don't want to die but i don't want to live. Part of me thinks I'll never find someone that makes me happy like she did because no one came close before that. If this is the wrong place for this, let me know. I just need help because ever since my life has just been spiraling down. Thanks for taking the time to read this everyone.
