Jesus 2 kids at 20 years old! Well at least you can talk over Facebook. Well you work out and you get some fresh air by walking the dog, that's great! It shows you're looking after yourself and working towards something. I keep on meaning to do some exercise and just keep procrastinating haha. It's a shame that you feel the way you do about your acne scars though. I know it won't change your mind about it but people honestly don't care. I think you're down playing your skillset though. Do you reckon you could fix computers? I'm not too technically minded when it comes to that but is there some way you could start a business from home. Do software fixes over remote access software? I dunno. Do you think you could see a job in the future repairing computers?What's your plan for tomorrow? Name one thing you will do tomorrow to help yourself. Either to help your acne scars, see a doctor about your mental wellbeing, or help your self confidence, or take the first step towards getting a job or whatever. It can be as big or a small a plan as you want, but do something to improve your situation tomorrow. If I sound like some wannabe motivational speaker I'm sorry haha, but I honestly do care. You've had it tough up to now and you need some support. I'm here whenever you want someone to talk to or bounce an idea off. Do you play games on the computer? I have a PS4 but I don't play a lot of games, I mostly use it for Netflix!
