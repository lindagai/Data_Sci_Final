First off, congrats on the sobriety! I wish you the best on that new path.Second, the sense of guilt you have for feeling sad is pretty common I think. But feelings are just that, feelings. You don't choose to be sad, you don't need to feel guilty for feeling sad. Besides there's people with countless life circumstances (some really good, some awful and everything in between) who deal with the same feelings. Depression doesn't discriminate.I hope you feel better, friend. But not because you feel guilty, but rather because you want to recover and experience the most you can out of life.
