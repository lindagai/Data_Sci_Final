Statistically speaking. 29 is an age that is considered late to not have been kissed on the mouth by a woman or a man in the modern society. I can't argue with you on that.It will be received as something unusual for outsiders. People tend to judge unconsciously and sometimes consciously others. Those who judge others without being presently aware of the processes that are going in their heads are not reflective enough and must realize that these quick instinct judgements are not well formed opinions nor thoughts. People that judge others consciously solely based on first impressions must read more books and reflect more around the matter \"on what defines someone\". Why a person is like this or that it is a complicated matter and why a person is a certain way doesn't make that person wholeheartedly weird, bad, cruel, nice, awesome and alike. The reasons for why someone has not been kissed can be grand, but whatever the reason is, to ruminate and bother oneself because of ones lack of romantic experience - although understandable and emotionally downing - is not beneficial. I think we can agree on that?To not have been kissed by your age (29) I can visualize does not feel good, but what else can you do then to remain open to romantic opportunities, work on yourself and improve yourself in every way you can. People like people that want to improve and it benefits the person that improves as well.There are other options of course as well, but the former is a positive life experience inducing activity that I approve of.
