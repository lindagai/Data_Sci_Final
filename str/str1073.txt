I'm school for computer engineering too, might switch to CS but I'm afraid I'm heading down the same path as well... No experience or internships while literally all of my friends have something for the summer. I'm stuck doing therapy for my depression which I feel like isn't helping much as I'm becoming more suicidal every week...
