I feel like tearing everything apart. I want everything to be done. To quit school, quit my job, leave my home, and just be done.I want to break up with him but I want him to just show up and tell me everything will be okay. I want him to see how much I am suffering and make it better, but I want to leave him. I want something terrible to happen to me. I want to die in an accident so my family won't hate me. I don't want to hurt them but I want to be gone. I drive too fast. I walk in the middle of the night. I go places I shouldn't. Feeling like it might happen gives me relief that I can't get with anything else. I love being afraidI need someone with me all the time. I can't be alone or I cry and suffer. I need him to leave me or to make it go away but I can't live like this. I want so much to tell him and make him understand, but I also see so many reasons I should break up with him. When I'm low I spin together all the reasons and I feel betrayed and like I need to leave him. I have no idea if they are real. What part of my brain is creating things and what is reality?I just need to go
