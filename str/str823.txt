I fee like I don't want to exist a lot. It comes and goes but when it comes, it's a very strong feeling. I try to isolate myself because of it and feel as though I can't envision a future for myself. I don't think I could pull myself to commit suicide because of the repercussions of it for my family but I just wish I wasn't born. I've been reading a lot into it recently and it seems other people have this feeling to. As though they just want someone else to put a gun to their head and pull the trigger. I've been looking at myself recently and can't tell if it cycles through or if I just hide it very well. How should I approach this? I went to a psychiatrist that is free to my college and after my initial visit I tried to pull back and realized I didn't want help so I acted like I was better but now I am back to my original state and feel like this again. One last thing about this feeling is that although it makes me feel empty and hopeless, it feels like an addiction. This sorrow and emptiness feels so good and I don't know why.
