I feel the same. I've super depressed for the past 4 years, I almost fail high school, ruined my life. Now I'm just staying home all day, afraid to even go out now because of my poor health. I tried to kill my self with sleeping pills overdose but that ended in hospital and expensive bills... I like you said have no more guts left to hurt myself but I wish someone could just snipe me to death right now. I want out.
