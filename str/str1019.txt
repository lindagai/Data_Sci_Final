and I'm slowly starting to be okay with that.  I can rock my job, plan activities for myself, go to bars alone, etc.  This is not ideal but it is all I have.  Then, the plan is, if I can stop being such a f'n downer, I might actually attract people in my life.  But yeah, it is rough.  I think about suicide a lot.  :(
