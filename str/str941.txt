English is not my first languange so pls no grammar nazis here.I dont see myself in the future with a loving family and wife because no one would actually be with me when sober. Im just ugly, goofy looking, a freaky creature on photos and i cant live like this.I see couples on the street and on ig/fb pics and i know in will never have that, so whats the point?And i know this sounds selfish, but nothing makes sense for me anymore so i want to just make good money robbing and drugdealing and enjoy life while i can. If i get caught ill just shoot myself in the head because i cant handle being locked in a cell all day and wasting YEARS of my life, worse, in a 3rd world prison.Im 23 with only high school educstion (i dont remember anything) and couldnt attend more than 3 days of college because of social anxiety and self esteem issues.I also have homicidal thoughts almost everyday but nothing too detailed.Does anyone here ever felt the same or something similar?Is this what they call nihilism/hedonism?
