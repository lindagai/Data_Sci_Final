Yeah I get that and now I'm hung up on another girl. I'm just hoping around but the reason I want to die is not because of a girl. I live and die on my own terms no ones actions will make me do anything apart from feel a certain way because when it comes down to it I make my choices and this is one, one that I have thought about a lot and one that makes a lot of sense to me.
