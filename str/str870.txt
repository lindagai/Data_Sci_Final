I am so sad. Last night he came home and woke me up banging dishes around because I left some in the sink because the dishwasher was running when I went to bed with the kids. I had to be at work at 5am. He told me the kids hate me and that they will never want to be with me. He told me I am crazy and lazy. I am depressed because of all the mean things he says and that makes me not want to go anywhere. And then because of that he calls me lazy, crazy. He tells me I should call my dad who sexually abused me when I was a kid. I don't want to live like this but I am so down because of all the things he does.
