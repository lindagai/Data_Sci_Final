It's actually really hard to upload this video. This is my Story, the good and the bad. As a kid I loved making movies, and had many great times performing and being creative.  But as a teenager I got  depressed, and have gone in and out of depression and anxiety for the last 10 years.  Recently I started meditating every day and through this practice I am beginning to let go of the anxiety and see things more clearly.  I am uploading this video in the hopes that it will help others going through depression and anxiety, as hearing other peoples stories helped me.
