it's been like that for years people keep telling me this is self created, i never had this and i made it in my head, maybe that's trueno matter who i reach out to, no one hears mei was my parents' regret, i am my family's burden, i am my friends' nuisance, everyone who loved me just diedi don't even think a therapist will help me, ill just go live my life with no emotions, no empathy, i just want to diewhy do i have to have emotions? i hate talking to people, i just want to be alone, i just don't want to face anyone anymorethe reality is that nobody cares, i tell friends who only say they care but if they had a chance they would go away from me, this world is a cruel place, i'm all alone, i don't mind dying, i don't mind dying. i just don't know how to deal with my emotions, if i could die and not feel the pain from the razor. i would do it
