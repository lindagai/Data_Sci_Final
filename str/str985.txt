I don't have a future I'm 29 I live with my parents and the reality of life is shit,  I would rather die than deal with people, I did stand up comedy for a  couple years something I loved forever but I have to have a real job to make money so I gave it up, I work customer service and I hope all the customers die, before I worked in a factory and I tried to hang myself. People care about me I know that,  but I can't just keep living to make other people happy anymore. My dream would to not wake up tomorrow
