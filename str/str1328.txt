I've been having those kinds of thoughts ever since I was 7. I used to believe in God, so I'd think to myself 'just step in front of that car and you'll see your family again in heaven' when I'd make a mistake.Had them hardcore in highschool, too. I used to think "I wonder if I'd be better off jumping off a bridge", among other things. I'm 25 now, and I sometimes have them, but I've learned how to be mindful during those episodes and remind myself of my goals.It sounds like you're just really hard on yourself, and have a bit of self-loathing that accelerates normal "I fucked up" thoughts to "I should die because I'm useless" thoughts. I'd suggest getting help with the self-hatred, since I have a feeling you'd never actually go through with killing yourself (I'm basing this off of us basically being the same person, and how I'd never do it.. though, I don't know you and you could very well want to).
