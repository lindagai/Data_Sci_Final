I'm also a library page and I've been in this job for way longer than I should because of how laid back the work and environment is.  Some days when I'm too depressed to physically do work, I'll go in the back office and put labels on books at a snails pace while scrolling through reddit or youtube.  Eventually I gather myself and get back to the more pressing tasks.  Also, I like the almost meditative repetitiveness of certain tasks, like packaging books for interlibrary loans.  And I'm allowed to listen to podcasts or audiobooks the whole day.There's something kind of cool about being a little cog in a machine that is actually providing an important service to the community.  I wish it paid better, but it's been good to me while I've been trying to get my life together.
