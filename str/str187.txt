I won't call anyone weak for their decisions, and you're not a coward for not pulling the trigger.  You have an indomitable drive to live.  You are worth the time and investment to find help for yourself.  It's difficult, you feel it, but that does not make you weak.  You're doing everything that the average person has to do in day-to-day life, and you're doing it with that proverbial 200lb gorilla on your back.  You're not weak at all.
