Isn't it funny, how therapists will insist that you need more and more therapy. Almost if if they're creating more business for themselves down the line.I've been dealing with similar problems. Just how long am I supposed to \"trust that the process will work\" when I'm still suicidal after 10 years of talking to people? How long will I have to sit there and fork over my money to people who promise that their services eventually will help, despite the fact that they have done precisely jack for me thus far? Imagine if a car mechanic worked that way. You bring your car into the shop once a week, pay a fee for them to do (?), and leave. The car doesn't seem to run any differently afterward. The check engine light is still on. It pulls to the right and rattles when you hit a bump. And yet you're throwing your money at them, week after week. And you're supposed to trust that 'the process will work'. Give me a fucking break.
