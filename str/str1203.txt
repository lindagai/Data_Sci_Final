You guys, what should be experienced as inconveniences today (lots of humans all in my space, having to go around at least 10 double parked cars on one street, dude staring at me at the gym, banging next door by neighbors) have turned into me feeling so sad about my life in the city.  And even though I'm probably (not sure) moving soon because of this, I think these things might follow me to the suburbs.  My doctor recently upped my geodon script to 60 mg from 40 because of the irritation.Somehow it all goes back to how alone I feel despite my 2 support groups and therapist.  I've isolated for like two years now, and I've tried to make friends here.  It isn't happening!  I'm worried that this will follow me too.I've made a lot of progress here but when I get so thrown off by petty shit like this it's SO frustrating.  I'm so tired of feeling like such an outsider in these ways.  Can anyone relate to this?  Thank you for letting me vent
