I am having the same problem. I want to stay away from my friends because I'll just spread my negativity if I tell them how I feel. Then when they say "you won't hurt me" I know they have no idea that how I feel is "I think about killing myself all day long". That would just scare them, so I try to stay away from them. But because they care, they keep asking how I am. I eventually just get short with them and say something mean. Then I feel like shit sitting alone at home about how I told them to leave me alone, making them feel like they are unable to help a friend in need. ALL THIS BULLSHIT JUST BECAUSE OF MY FUCKING BRAIN! It's so fucking absurd, I hate how weak I am and how my chemicals work against me every day.
