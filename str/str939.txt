Recently I've been getting 12 hours of sleep and then napping for another 4 during the day.  Despite all this sleep it feels like I very literally didn't sleep at all.  I struggle to have the energy to do the smallest shit like walking up the stairs, going to the bathroom, maintaining concentration while reading an online news article.  I was just sitting at my desk for 15 minutes watching youtube videos and felt a wave a lightheadedness and exhaustion.  This is an hour after i woke up from 12 hours of sleep.  Before suggest the usual crap I'll tell you that I have tried the doctors recommendation to eat as healthy as possible and exercise daily.  I have done both with no change if maybe more tired.  I got blood tests for everything under the sun there is nothing unusual.  I really want to die.  It's funny you never think something as simple as feeling tired all the time would be so emotionally crushing but it is.  I can't meet up with friends I can't focus on making music , certainly go to school or get a job.  I hear often when you are depressed you arent 'actually tired', but let me tell you i sure as shit feel actually tired.  and the times i have tried to push myself through the lack of energy i usually feel like fainting and overall just have bad inhibition, especially when riding a bike for example.  anyone feel the same?  what should we do?
