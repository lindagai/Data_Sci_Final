You and me both to be honest. With all the bullshit happening in my life, it's making my future seem dark and grim. I don't want to live a life where I have no job, constantly sick, and alone. It's starting to seem like suicide is my only escape from such a future, so I can sort of understand where you're coming from.Sounds silly, but I really wish life had a reset button like a video game.
