I don't have any friends. It sucks because I don't have anybody to complain about my problems to. I just walk around my room and throw a stress ball across the room to keep from crying. My life sucks. I'm 18 years old, I still live with my parents, I don't have a job, or even an ID card. I literally just sit around the house, play videogames, clean up, eat, shit and sleep. I just met this awesome girl with whom I play GTA V with, and she really likes me, or rather she likes the person that I portray(which isn't me lying, but just leaving out all the bad things about me). We talk on Instagram and XBL Party Chat, and even if we're in a party full of guys, she'll show special attention to me, ME of all the obviously handsome, cool, and probably hung guys. She makes me the happiest guy in the world. When I asked her why she liked me so much, she simply told me because I wasn't fake and trying to be better than anyone else. She gave me her number, wherein likes problem #1: I use iMessage, and she has an Android phone. It should be, \"we should just keep DMing on Instagram,\" but it isn't! I don't have a phone number, and she really wants to text me. Problem #2: I'm like 6'1\
