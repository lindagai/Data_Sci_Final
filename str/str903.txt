Lately I've been getting sad for no reason. I'm 21, and I have no car, and my social life is basically non-existant. My girlfriend of over a year broke up with me a few days after my birthday last month. We had plans to move in together, even put a deposit down on an apartment. I honestly don't know why she wanted to end it, but I don't blame her. I moved in anyway. I don't know if I have clinical depression, I haven't been to a doctor, but I lose interests in things really quick, and sometimes I just start crying if I'm not occupying myself with something. I like video games and playing guitar, but doing either of those things for more than a few minutes is difficult, and I don't have anyone to game with anymore. I enjoy seeing what few friends I have, but not having a car makes that hard too, and I never get invited out anyway. Social situations can be really stressful, so I never ever go to parties. I don't have thoughts about suicide, but sometimes I think about dying in other ways, like in my sleep, and how that would solve my problems. I'm in college, and it's been a struggle since day one. I don't think I was ready for it, but I felt so much pressure to go so I did, and since I didn't get any scholarships I'm just building up a mountain of student loan debt. I haven't made any new friends since freshman year, only acquaintances. I know a bunch of people who are in really tight knit circles of friends, but I don't have anything like that. No one to make memories with. I've tried using tinder, but after meeting a few different girls I just realized I still have strong feelings for the girl who broke my heart, so I deleted my account. I don't really know what else to say, I feel like I'm rambling. I hope some of you have some insight or advice. Thank you to anyone who read this.
