I have to get this load of garbage off my chest. I'm 50 years old,  I have no wife, no kids and a job that pays a below a living wage. I'm sort of religious but I advoid get togethers because I'm usually a third wheel since there a only families in attendance. I have been told by fellow congregants that I should give up on anything even close to having a family. I've been questioned by one person as to my motives in attending this particular house of worship, that I shouldn't be wife shopping and that it made some women uneasy.  So now I have to find another house of worship. My metabolism is going crazy and none of the medications are helping so I have always been 150lbs overweight, making me repulsive to others and myself and I assume GD. I look back and see only missed opportunities and failed attemps at having a normal life. I can't blame my parents, who are two of the most loving parents one could hope for they have given so much love but all I ever did was cause them pain and disappointment. If not for them I would have blown my fat head off a long time ago. I hate myself for all of the above and not a moment goes by that I don't think about being dead, to not exist, to be able to crawl away in to nothingness with all my failures and my disgusting appearance. GD hates me and so do I.
