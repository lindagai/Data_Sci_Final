I agree that down voting is bad; but many, many times I have seen people perpetuate depressive thoughts on this thread. It makes sense considering the subject matter being dealt with. There are great users, hell, I'm not one of them. Positive reinforcement should be preached though, and while it often is, I almost feel as if some users want others with depression to feel bad, worse than they do. Maybe I'm just spouting ignorance. I haven't been here for long, so it's just my initial impression.
