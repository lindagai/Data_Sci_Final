I don't want to bring others down with my problems. I've done enough of that. I just want an interaction with someone ,who I don't have to put up a front with. I have no friends irl who I'm completely open with, and as I'm a  long time lurker I've never made Internet friends. If anyone else wants to talk ,I'm here.
