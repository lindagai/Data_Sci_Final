Most of the time I feel nothing. I don't feel sad or happy, sometimes angry (at things other people do) but rarely. When I do feel, which is usually at school, the feelings hit really fucking hard. I feel like I don't deserve to be a member of society, to have a house or family or friends. I feel like the scum of this earth.Sorry for this poorly put together post.
