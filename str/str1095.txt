I'm a 20 year old male. I'm a friendless virgin. I've accomplished nothing with my life, I dropped out 6 years ago now. I feel especially unattractive, not extremely ugly, but to the point where there's something about my face that I think screams \"low quality human being,\" if that makes any sense. I have acne scars all over my face, I look like an old man in a way. I'm almost 21, \"in my prime,\" right? I don't suffer from acne as much as I used to (3 new pustules on my face daily a few years ago), but I do--there are red spots and slight pustules now. Better yes, but everyone seems to have clear skin and decent or good looks, and then there's me, being unattractive AND having shit skin.My self esteem is awful. I used to get bullied in school and treated like trash/ostracized most of the time I was in school. I would get bullied for my appearance, how I walked, how I talked, etc. At 12 I told my mom and older brother I wanted to kill myself and that I'm being bullied, no one cared or even tried to help, no comforting words.My family is mildly dysfunctional, I strongly believe we have depression in our genetics, everyone seems to have depression in my family, even my grandparents. And as for my father.. he molested my sister and I haven't seen him since I was 2 or something. No contact, no money. Thanks for bringing me into this world, dad.I'm beginning to think suicide is the right answer for me. My genetics suck. I suck. I'm a burden to my family. I'm entirely unproductive, I can't accomplish simple tasks like finishing my GED. I can't get a job because I feel too ugly and ashamed of my appearance. What's stopping me from ordering a bunch of high quality heroin and ODing? I really don't know. I don't like my body or my face, or me in general, and as far as I can tell, this is permanent. I'm sick of not being able to feel anything but boredom or anger day in, day out.
