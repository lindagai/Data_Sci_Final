When I was in high school I did see a psychiatrist and it was mainly because at that time my parents split up and I was young, I didn't really know how to deal with it. I would take time out of classes to go and see him and for the most part it helped out, but it only lasted about a month and then I didn't see him again after that.I've always considered looking for a psychiatrist again but I don't know how I could do it, I'm really socially anxious apart from on the internet... I can communicate here fairly easily in most circumstances but over the phone or in person it can lead to panic attacks and that really sucks.I hope you all the best if you find a psychiatrist though, and I hope it works for you. I too was given meds before my pre-mentioned help in high school and I was probably 13? I can't really remember, but they made me really aggressive and that was obviously not helping.I'm glad video games work for you too, something about being in another world as a different person really helps move me away from day to day struggles and as I said it sometimes really helps me cope
