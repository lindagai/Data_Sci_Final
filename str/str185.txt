The person who doesn't fail doesn't learn. That's a bit cliche and even a bit stupid, but I've found it to be true. Be it at work, or video games, or your personal life, or being an adult in general; If you don't fuck up, and sometimes fuck up real big, you're never going to learn anything and you'll be an asshole your entire life. You can be a fuck up, or a failure, or a loser, or anything shitty, but if at the very least you're not an asshole, you have a massive leg up on most people in the world.  Things take time, some people need more time than others. You'll find your way, you just gotta keep trying and keep pushing forward. If you ever need someone to bullshit with or talk to, i keep things down to earth and i'm down to talk to you. Don't be afraid to shoot me a PM. I certainly have my own issues and i'd consider myself a bit of a failure too, but i'm not an asshole. At least I have that going for me.
