ill be your friend. my life resonates with yours! I'm not the best looking guy and i also wouldn't exactly say I'm that smart. i was voted "most clueless" in high school, because i was a complete a social retard. I'm currently a second year in college and my life is a complete disaster as well. was on anti-depressants but recently stopped after realizing that they were just making my depression worse. and the reason for your inability to articulate your ideas may be due to your anxiety and fear of what others think of you. just try to be yourself and you should be fine. you shouldn't care what other people think of you. i know its hard to change that mentality but its essential to gain confidence. btw i used to have that problem as well. but then again i don't know if my words are that reliable as I am still somewhat of a social retard
