I can't sleep, my fiance is already snoring. I know he'd wake up and talk to me if I asked but he has to get up early for work. I'm getting married, we don't know when tho. I'm in a ldr and I've never been happier, I went to visit him 2 weeks ago and he proposed in Chicago, near the Buckingham fountain, he was so nervous it was really adorable.I'm moving to US after we file the fiance visa papers, it takes about 5 months, we are hoping it would take less. I guess I haven't been able to sleep because I'm thinking about all the changes that will happen. I won't be able to see my sisters often, I'll be closer to my mom so that's a good thing. I'll be pretty much alone, he will be my only support and that has never happened before, so I feel shaky not because I don't trust him because I do, it's just because I've never given myself the way I am doing it with him. I'm sorry this post is not crazy interesting, I just wanted to talk I guess
