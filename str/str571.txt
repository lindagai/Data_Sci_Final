Have you spoken to anybody about all this?Family, friends, professionals, whatever. Definitely explore other options before turning to being medicated.But it does really help some people so you can explore the option. Make sure you try to force yourself to get out and hang with your friends, or make new ones somehow. It's hard, but that helped me a lot in a similar situation.
