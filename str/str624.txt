This happens to me to. I can make it though the day most time (sometimes i break but people do usually see that).  people tell me there glad to see I'm happy and i just cant say what really is happening because It feels like complaining and know one wants to heir complaining and I'm afraid they will get tired or something like that and just leave. I cant get help because if i tell my parents its the teenage blues even wen I just lose all energy or just get so overwhelmed all i can do is shutdown or cry. I think the biggest problem is lack of being able to communicate and have a close relationship. Its mainly just smile and small talk.
