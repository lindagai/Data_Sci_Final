I'm really sorry this is all happening to you. I've had similar experiences but nothing like this and I can't imagine how it's affecting you right now. Do you think closure would make you feel better? From what I've had to deal with, sometimes it makes me feel worse when the other person doesn't react exactly the way I want them to and she doesn't seem very receptive to your distress.
