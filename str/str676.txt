Don't be scared! You just did an awesome thing for yourself. Regardless of the outcome, you're being proactive and getting to the bottom of resolving how you feel. I was worried when I first talked to my GP for the first time about depression...turns out I had some nutritional deficiencies that contributed to my moods (Vit D, iron). Knowing that I could be treated and help alleviate some of the symptoms was a huge relief. Good luck.
