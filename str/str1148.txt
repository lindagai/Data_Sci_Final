Okay so, just as a little background, I'm a junior in high school and have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. I see a therapist about once a month and am currently not on medication. I've had general anxiety for most of my life, but one thing that has gotten more prevalent since I started high school are very obsessive thoughts. I'll be having a great day until a random worry hits my mind and I can't get my mind off of it for the life of me. I just think about it over and over to the point that I get nauseous. I keep trying to find a solution to whatever problem I'm thinking about, but usually nothing comes. This can happen anytime of day, but most often it comes at night. One of the main things that causes me to obsess is my fear of missing out. When I say missing out, I don't necessarily mean missing out on big parties or whatever, I even get anxious over missing small conversations. I'm in the band in my high school, and there are a fairly large amount of people I would consider to be friends. This is nice and not I'm not complaining, but it does cause issues when I don't know who to hang out with or talk to. If there's a case where everyone's together but everyone's broken into smaller groups, I have trouble deciding which group to be with. I'm so worried that if I choose one group I will regret it or miss out on something in another. When I'm at home, I spend hours deciding which friends are better in different situations or coming up with scenarios and deciding from there. I just get completely obsessed with it. There just isn't a clear answer to the problem and it bothers me to no end.So, any advice? It gets so frustrating because I feel like I'm spending so much time worrying about everything that I'm not enjoying my time in high school as much as I could be, and I would love to at least make things a little better.
