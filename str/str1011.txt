I don't want to be hereI wish I didn't existNothing makes since and I feel like a deerCaught in headlights behind some mistSix feet under or five foot nine standing uprightIt doesn't matter I'm rotting insideBlack lungs and black holes in my brain as black as the nightNothing can keep it supsided, can't even hideI wish I was highI wish I was deadThe end is nighCan't even get out of bedSomeone save me, oh god help me.Why doesn't anyone like me?
