I'm going off to college for the first time in a couple days, and I'm worried that nobody's going to like me. I've never had tons of friends, and the friends I do have I've known forever. I don't know how to make friends with new people. I've never even had a real relationship with anybody. What is I'm just an unlikable person? What if I can't manage to make any friends at college and I'm still as lonely there as I am at home?
