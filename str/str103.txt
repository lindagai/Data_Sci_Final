I'm actually in a grad program now, but I'm really too depressed to keep up with the work load.  Also it's a lot of math and comp sci, which I probably could do if I had the motivation and discipline, but the concepts are too hard when I'm not invested in mastering them. Idk, I was sitting in Calc 3 just thinking  \" I can barely picture what's going on right now, and it's gonna take 3-4 hours of homework a day before this stuff even starts to click. \"  So I said fuck it, dropped the course and plan to leave the program.  Which puts me right where I was a year ago, looking at jobs requiring 2-3 years prior experience.
