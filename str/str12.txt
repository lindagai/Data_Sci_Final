No, that shit isn't fair. There isn't a reason behind tragedy - it just happens. Often to people who don't deserve it. I'm sorry you're going through this. There's nothing wrong with still missing your family and being depressed over what happened to them. People who aren't depressed will often end up moving on because they don't understand that depression can't be helped with a night out. Crying on their shoulder once or twice won't make you better. And when they start to see that they can't bring you out of your funk, they just see someone who's a bummer to be around. It sucks.
