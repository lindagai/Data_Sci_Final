My Lord God, I have no idea where I am going.     I do not see the road ahead of me.     I cannot know for certain where it will end. Nor do I really know myself,    and the fact that I think I am following your will does not mean that I am actually doing so.    But I believe that the desire to please you does in fact please you.    And I hope I have that desire in all that I am doing.    I hope that I will never do anything apart from that desire.    And I know that if I do this you will lead me by the right road,    though I may know nothing about it.    Therefore I will trust you always though I may seem to be lost and in the shadow of death.    I will not fear,    for you are ever with me,    and you will never leave me to face my perils alone.    Amen.
