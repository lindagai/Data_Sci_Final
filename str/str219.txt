I sometimes get the same thing. I'm a talker, but somehow still an introvert at heart and I have social anxiety. I often become exasperated with how socially incompetent I feel when I go out. The happiness of others can also be grating when you are down. It all just makes me feel like a fuck up and I end up spiraling into asking myself hurtful questions. \"Why can't I be happy? It looks so effortless. Why are they able to navigate work so easily while I struggle? Why can't I speak like a normal fucking person?
