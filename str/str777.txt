I used to cut, and I was alone all the time. Now I'm almost never not with a friend, and my relationship is going great. Yet sometimes I catch myself wishing something would go wrong, so that i could relapse. I miss cutting, and somehow I even miss the depression that prompted it. For me, I think I just deserve it. I feel guilty about my wonderful life, because I don't think I've earned it. Or something.Maybe it's just that I'm scared of the responsibility implied by a happy life, and I want to kill myself just because it'd be easier. Then I feel bad because I'm lazy and a coward, and then I think I'm just trying to convince myself to be sad again. I'm going in circles, man. But the point is I think I can relate. It feels like I want to get worse.
