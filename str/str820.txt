Well, I regret I was born.I am angry on my parents, that I was born.It's their fault I was born, so it doesn't allow them to make me angry.I don't have a job I would like to do after studies.Parents don't give me money for training just like that.I can't find a small job to get on training and anythings.Idk what to do, betting?I loss.I just have nothing to live for.I would like to die and never wake up.I can't sit in front of the desk until I will retire at 70.The life like this for me makes no sense.Life isn't for me.The girl I love ignores me.I have nothing left.I want to die and just don't have troubless, worries anymore.What the hell to do?
