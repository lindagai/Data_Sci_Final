I have a lot going for me now than I did two months ago, but I'm again realizing that I'm kind of a piece of shit. I'm not empathetic at all, I'm naturally selfish, I'm annoying, I'm unlikable (everyone at my new school loves me but I feel like I'm wearing a mask), I struggle with alcohol, people in my own family hate me and it's my fault, and to top it off I'm very suicidal again. I'm a bad person and I really want to die because of it. Just wanted to say it out loud because I'm really thinking about ways I could kill myself right now
