As you probably know, there is good solid evidence for improving mental health by (1) exercise, (2) being sociable, (3) being in a green outdoor setting.  I want to synthesize all of these things together for multiplying effects.  I thought it would be a good idea to create a meetup(.com) where I show up a couple times a week at the park with a few fitness tools and encourage others to join in and skip rope together, stretch rubber bands, lift water jugs, etc.  Any advice?I need advice for:###tools:- a couple gallon jugs and a pole to hang them from to create a barbell? (there's a pond, so i can fill the water jugs there and avoid shlepping mass)- stretch bungies?- lift each other?- a couple laps of the park?- badminton?- what are some lightweight tools i can bring that everyone can share, or that others could bring?- etc###What should we do exactly?- how many reps of what?- use the PX-100 or similar? (can't remember the name of the program)- 5 min quiet group breathing/mindfulness- etc###Sociability aspect- 2x/wk enough?  sun/wed/fri?- a card to mark off our progress?  (weight, reps, distance, mood)- dietary tie-in (everyone bring a juice without sugar? or a healthy snack to share?  hit a healthy resto afterward?)To make it simple i want like 3 program options.  Each program made of 3-5 steps.  Each person picks a program and i give them an index card to start marking off accomplishments/progress a la /r/thexeffect.  Programs would be like, "pick one: Chest/arms, Cardio focus, Tummy focus."  something like that.This is just a sketch of an idea.  I you guys make it sound doable and help fill in the blanks, I really want to list it and see who shows up over time.  I think that creating this will also stimulate some motivation on my part since i'd have to be the guy who shows up with the stuff. the man with the plan.  i'm already a man, just need some pointers on the plan itself :)Or is this already i thing being done out there that i can simply copy?
