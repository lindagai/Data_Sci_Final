Hi reddit. I wanted to post this because i dont think ive ever told anyone or will ever tell anyone my secret before I kill myself, this is my confession. When I was about 10-11 years old I would sneak into my little sisters bedroom and sexually assault her in her sleep. I was an early bloomer so I was able to get sexual pleasure and an orgasm at this age. I never penetrated her or even woke her up but I would use her sleeping body to stimulate myself and she was only 4 at the time. She has no recollection of this. For my whole life onward I have been ashamed and guilty. Im honestly a piece of shit and ive come to the realization that I deserve to die. Im about to turn 20 in a few months and ive decided to end it all on my birthday. I've tried for years to convince myself that I didnt know what I was doing was bad but I knew exactly what I was doing and I continued this for months. I was ruining the innocence of my sweet little sister. This wonderful girl who i loved so much. I dont ask you to forgive me. I dont ask that of anyone. I can only say that i'm so sorry. I really love you my sweet sister. If you see this know that not a single second goes by that I dont regret what ive done.
